## 7. **Kibbidhānakappa**


### Paṭhamakaṇḍa


> **(Ka)**

> Buddhaṃ ñāṇasamuddaṃ, sabbaññuṃ lokahetu’khīṇamatiṃ;
> Vanditvā pubbamahaṃ, vakkhāmi sasādhanaṃ hi kitakappaṃ.

> **(Kha)**

> Sādhanamūlaṃ hi payogaṃ,
> Āhu payogamūlamatthañca;
> Atthesu visāradamatayo,
> Sāsanassudharā jinassa matā.

> **(Ga)**

> Andho desakavikalo,
> Ghatamadhutelāni bhājanena vinā;
> Naṭṭho naṭṭhāni yathā,
> Payogavikalo tathā attho.

> **(Gha)**

> Tasmā saṃrakkhaṇatthaṃ, munivacanatthassa dullabhassāhaṃ;
> Vakkhāmi sissakahitaṃ, kitakappaṃ sādhanena yutaṃ.

### First Chapter


**(Ka)**

I pay homage to the Buddha, the ocean of knowledge, all-knowing, the benefactor of the world with unbounded wisdom;
Having paid homage, I will explain, for the benefit of my predecessors, the means of achievement, which is of great benefit.

**(Kha)**

The root of achievement is indeed application,
They say application is the root of achievement and its meaning;
Those skilled in meanings,
Are considered the purifiers of the teaching of the Victor.

**(Ga)**

A blind man, imperfect in teaching,
Is like a pot of honey without a spoon;
One who is unskilled is like one who is unskilled,
In the same way, one who is imperfect in application is unskilled in meaning.

**(Gha)**

Therefore, for the sake of preservation, of the words of the sage, which are difficult to obtain;
I will explain, for the benefit of my students, the means of achievement, endowed with application.
