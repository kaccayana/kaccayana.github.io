### Sixth Chapter


**271**, {ref}`88<88>`, {ref}`308<308>`. Whatever one goes to or is afraid of or takes, that is the object of going.

Whatever one goes to, whatever one is afraid of, whatever one takes, that is the agent of the object of going.

How is that? 

The monks go to the village, 

the king leaves the city, 

fear arises from the thieves, 

the pupil receives instruction from the teacher and tutor.

Where is the locative of the object of going expressed? 

The locative of the object of going is the fifth case.

Of the dhatu names and in the compounds of upasagga, etc., as well, that kāraka is apādānasañña.

In the use of dhātus, for instance, of the dhātu that is used in the latter part, that which is inseparable is apādānasañña.

What is that?

Like: Buddhasmā parājenti aññatitthiyā.

Of the dhātu that is used in the former part, from which there is an unbroken origin, that is apādānasañña.

What is that?

Like: Himavatā pabhavanti pañca mahānadiyo, anavatattamhā pabhavanti mahāsarā, aciravatiyā pabhavanti kunnadiyo.

In the use of names as well, that kāraka is apādānasañña.

What is that?

Like: Urasmā jāto putto, bhūmito niggato raso, ubhato sujāto putto mātito ca pitito ca.

In the compound of upasagga, that kāraka is apādānasañña.

What is that?

Like: Apasālāya āyanti vāṇijā, ābrahmalokā saddo abbhuggacchati, upari pabbatā devo vassati, buddhasmā pati sāriputto dhammadesanāya bhikkhū ālapati temāsaṃ, ghatamassa telasmā pati dadāti, uppalamassa padumasmā pati dadāti, kanakamassa hiraññasmā pati dadāti.

By taking the beginning, in the middle of the kāraka as well, the fifth case is used.

Like: Ito pakkhasmā vijjhati migaṃ luddako, kosā vijjhati kuñjaraṃ, māsasmā bhuñjati bhojanaṃ.

By taking after, in the use of nipāta as well, the fifth case is used, and the second and third.

Like: Rahitā mātujā puññaṃ katvā dānaṃ deti, rahitā mātujaṃ, rahitā mātujena vā, rite saddhammā kuto sukhaṃ labhati, rite saddhammaṃ, rite saddhammena vā, te bhikkhū nānā kulā pabbajitā, vinā saddhammā natthañño koci nātho loke vijjati, vinā saddhammaṃ, vinā saddhammena vā, vinā buddhasmā, vinā buddhaṃ, vinā buddhena vā.

By taking with, the fifth case is used in other ways as well.

Like: Yatohaṃ bhagini ariyāya jātiyā jāto, yato sarāmi attānaṃ, yato pattosmi viññutaṃ, yatvādhikaraṇamenaṃ cakkhundriyaṃ asaṃvutaṃ viharantaṃ abhijjhādomanassā pāpakā akusalā dhammā anvāsaveyyuṃ.

### 273 (310): Rakkhaṇatthānamicchitaṃ

> Rakkhaṇatthānaṃ dhātūnaṃ payoge yaṃ icchitaṃ, taṃ kārakaṃ apādānasaññaṃ hoti.

> Kāke rakkhanti taṇḍulā, 

> yavā paṭisedhenti gāvo.

### 273 (310): Intended for Protection

The intended purpose of protection of the roots in application, that which is desired, becomes the kāraka with the meaning of apādāna.

Crows protect the rice, 

cattle forbid the barley.

### 274 (311): Yena vā’ dassanaṃ

> Yena vā adassanamicchitaṃ, taṃ kārakaṃ apādānasaññaṃ hoti.

> Upajjhāyā antaradhāyati sisso, 

> mātarā ca pitarā ca antaradhāyati putto.

> Vāti kimatthaṃ? 

> Sattamīvibhatyattaṃ. 

> Jetavane antaradhāyati bhagavā.

Whatever is unseen or desired to be unseen, that factor becomes the locative of the verb 'to hide'.

The pupil hides from the teacher, 

the child hides from the mother and the father.

What is the point of 'vā'? 

It is for the sake of the seventh case construction.

The Lord hides in the Jetavana.

The taking of the sense is for the purpose of explanation, and for the purpose of connecting the words.

Whatever words are not included here for the application of sampadāna, they are included here for the purpose of taking.

How is that? 
This Blessed One is the lord of the Bhikkhu Saṅgha,
