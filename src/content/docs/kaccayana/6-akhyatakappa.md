### First Chapter

**(Ka)**

The ocean of verbs, with its waves of derivative words, 
The water of roots, with its fish of suffixes and prefixes;
The shore of exceptions, with its boundary of word division, 
Is crossed by wise poets with a ship of broad understanding.

**(Kha)**

This elaborate and extensive word of the Buddha, 
Is fully examined and well-investigated;
Having bowed to the fully awakened one of infinite range, 
Listen to me as I speak of the well-ranged word.

**(Ga)**

In the chapter on auspiciousness, and also in the chapter on completion and retention;
And in the subsequent chapter on words, the word is explained.
