### 1 (1): Attho akkharasaññāto (Meaning is denoted by letters/sounds)

> Sabbavacanānamattho akkhareheva saññāyate.
>
> Akkharavipattiyaṃ hi atthassa dunnayathā hoti, tasmā akkharakosallaṃ bahūpakāraṃ suttantesu.

> [!NOTE]
> `akkhara` means “constant, durable, long-lasting” and in the context of Kaccāyana it means “sounds, tones, words” and also the letters of the alphabetical syllabary.

All meanings of words are based on the recognition of “akkhara” (sounds, or letters). A mistaken akkhara result in difficulty in interpreting meaning, therefore proficiency in akkhara is extremely helpful in (deciphering) the rules (or understanding the suttas in the Tipiṭaka).

> The “Brahmi” script introduced here is one of the earliest scripts known to India. It came into existence in the form of stone inscriptions during the reign of Asoka, in 4th - 3rd century BCE.

And there are forty one `akkhara` constructed from sounds/syllables, starting with `a`.

### 10 (12): Pubbamadhoṭhita massaraṃ sarena viyojaye

> Tattha sandhiṃ kattukāmo pubbabyañjanaṃ adhoṭhitaṃ assaraṃ katvā sarañca upari katvā sarena viyojaye.

> Tatrāyamādi.

## translation

### 10 (12): Previously, the consonant group is separated by a vowel

There, one who wants to form a sandhi, having made the preceding consonant low and the following consonant unlow, and having made the vowel above, separates by a vowel.

This is the rule.

---

<a name="m11"></a>

### 11 (14): Naye paraṃ yutte

> Assaraṃ kho byañjanaṃ adhoṭhataṃ parakkharaṃ naye yutte.

> Tatrābhiratimiccheyya.

> Yuttetikasmā?

> Akkocchi maṃ avadhi maṃ, ajini maṃ ahāsi me.

> Ettha pana yuttaṃ na hoti.

11 (14): In a logical statement

Indeed, the consonant is pronounced with a low tone, the consonant after it with a high tone in a logical statement.

There is a desire for a higher tone.

Why is it called 'yutta'?

You abused me, limited me, beat me, struck me.

But here it is not called 'yutta'.

---

> _Iti sandhikappe paṭhamo kaṇḍo._

11 (14): In the case of a logical conclusion

Indeed, the consonant assaraṃ is placed below the consonant parakkharaṃ in a logical conclusion.

There is a desire for a higher tone.

Why is it called yutta?

You abused me, limited me, beat me, and struck me.

But here it is not called yutta.

_Thus ends the first chapter on sandhi._

### Dutiyakaṇḍa

<a name="m12"></a>

### 12 (13): Sarā sare lopaṃ

> Sarā kho sare pare lopaṃ papponti.

> Yassindriyāni samathaṅgatāni.

> No hetaṃ bhante

> sametāyasmā saṅghena.

12 (13): The Sarā (letters) lose their Sarā (sound)

The Sarā indeed lose their Sarā sound on others.

When the faculties are well-established.

This is not so, venerable sir,

together with the venerable community.

---

<a name="m13"></a>

### 13 (15): Vā paro asarūpā

> Saramhā asarūpā paro saro lopaṃ pappoti vā.

> Cattāro’me bhikkhave dhammā,

> kinnu’ māvasamaṇiyo.

> Vāti kasmā?

> Pañcindriyāni,

> tayassu dhammā jahitā bhavanti.

13 (15): Or the other is formless

The formless one obtains the disappearance of form or the other.

These four things, monks,

what are they, monk?

Why the "or"?

The five faculties,

those things are abandoned in him.

---

<a name="m14"></a>

### 14 (16): Kvacāsacaṇṇaṃ lutte

> Saro kho paro pubbasare lutte kvaci asavaṇṇaṃ pappoti.

> Saṅkhyaṃ nopeti vedagū,

> bandhusseva samāgamo.

> Kvacīti kasmā?

> Yassindriyāni,

> tathūpamaṃ dhammavaraṃ adesayi.

14 (16): Occasionally to the naked

A monk indeed, in the early morning, occasionally gets an impure color.

The sage does not reach a number,

the coming together is like a relative.

Why occasionally?

For one whose faculties are thus,

he teaches the excellent dhamma in like manner.

---

<a name="m15"></a>

### 15 (17): Dīghaṃ

> Saro kho paro pubbasare lutte kvaci dīghaṃ pappoti.

> Saddhīdha vittaṃ purisassa seṭṭhaṃ,

> anāgārehi cūbhayaṃ.

> Kvacīti kasmā?

> Pañcahupāli aṅgehi samannāgato.

> Natthaññaṃ kiñci.

15 (17): Dīghaṃ

A particle indeed, in the previous period, when elided, sometimes becomes long.

Faith is the wealth of a man, the best,

in both laymen and monks.

Why 'sometimes'?

Because it is provided with five exceptions.

There is nothing else.

---

<a name="m16"></a>

### 16 (18): Pubbo ca

> Pubbo ca saro parasaralope kate kvaci dīghaṃ pappoti.

> Kiṃsūdha vittaṃ purisassa seṭṭhaṃ,

> sādhūti paṭissuṇitvā,

> kvacīti kasmā?

> Itissa muhuttampi.

16 (18): Pubbo ca

Previously, a vowel and a consonant having been combined, sometimes a long (vowel) is obtained.

What is the wealth of a man, the best?

Having answered "good speech",

where is "sometimes"?

For a moment, of such a man.

---

<a name="m17"></a>

### 17 (19): Yamedantassādeso

> Ekārassa antabhūtassa sare pare kvaci yakārādeso hoti.

> Adhigato kho myāyaṃ dhammo,

> tyāhaṃ evaṃ vadeyyaṃ,

> tyāssa pahīnā honti.

> Kvacīti kasmā?

> Ne’nāgatā,

> iti nettha.

17 (19): Yamedantassādeso

Of the internal ekāra that has become the end, sometimes the yakāra substitution occurs.

This doctrine has been understood by me,

thus I would speak,

thus those are abandoned by him.

Sometimes, why?

Because they are not to be come,

thus it is not so.

---

<a name="m18"></a>

### 18 (20): Vamodudantānaṃ

> Okārukārānaṃ antabhūtānaṃ sare pare kvaci vakārādeso hoti.

> Atha khvassa,

> svassa hoti,

> bahvābādho,

> vatthvettha vihitaṃ niccaṃ cakkhāpāthamāgacchati.

> Kvacītikasmā?

> Cattāro’me bhikkhave dhammā,

> kinnumāva samaṇiyo.

### 18 (20): Vamodudantānaṃ

Of the Okārukārānaṃ that have become internal, sometimes the substitute of "va" is found at the end.

Then indeed,

it is its own,

there is much danger,

the constant eye-salve prescribed for the skin is applied.

From what reason?

These four things, monks,

are like a ascetic.

---

<a name="m19"></a>

### 19 (22): Sabbo caṃti

> Sabbo icceso tisaddo byañjano sare pare kvaci cakāraṃ pappoti.

> Iccetaṃ kusalaṃ, iccassa vacanīyaṃ, paccuttaritvā, paccāharati.

> Kvacīti kasmā?

> Itissa muhuttampi.

19 (22): Sabbo caṃti

Everything is called a word when three sounds or a vowel and a consonant and a visarga are obtained somewhere.

It is called "iccessa" when it is good, "iccessa" is to be spoken, having answered, having brought.

Why "somewhere"?

Because of (the word) "itissa" for a moment.

---

<a name="m20"></a>

### 20 (27): Do dhassa ca

> Dhaiccetassa sare pare kvaci dakārādeso hoti.

> Ekamidāhaṃ bhikkhave samayaṃ.

> Kvacīti kasmā?

> Idheva maraṇaṃ bhavissati.

> Vaggahaṇena dhakārassa hakārādeso hoti sāhu dassana mariyānaṃ.

> Suttavibhāgena bahudhā siyā-

> To dassa, yathā? Sugato.

> Ṭo tassa, yathā? Dukkaṭaṃ.

> Dho tassa, yathā? Gandhabbo.

> Tro ttassa, yathā? Atrajo.

> Ko gassa, yathā? Kulūpako.

> Lo rassa, yathā? Mahāsālo.

> Jo yassa, yathā? Gavajo.

> Bbo vissa, yathā? Kubbato.

> Ko yassa, yathā? Sake.

> Yo jassa, yathā? Niyaṃputtaṃ.

> Ko tassa, yathā? Niyako.

> Cco ttassa, yathā bhacco.

> Pho passa, yathā? Nipphatti.

> Kho kassa, yathā? Nikkhamati.

> Iccevamādī yojetabbā.

20 (27): Of dhassa also

For dhaiccetassa, in some cases, the substitute dakāra is used.

There is one instance, monks.

Why 'in some cases'?

Here death will occur.

By the rule of substitution, the substitute hakāra is used for dhakāra, as seen in the example of death.

In the analysis of the sutta, it becomes many -

What is that instance, namely? The Sugato.

What is that of it, namely? Dukkaṭaṃ.

What is its dh, namely? Gandhabbo.

What is its tr, namely? Atrajo.

What is its k, namely? Kulūpako.

What is its l, namely? Mahāsālo.

What is its j, namely? Gavajo.

What is its bb, namely? Kubbato.

What is its k, namely? Sake.

What is its y, namely? Niyaṃputtaṃ.

What is its k, namely? Niyako.

What is its cc, namely? Bhacco.

What is its ph, namely? Nipphatti.

What is its kh, namely? Nikkhamati.

Such and similar ones should be connected.

### 21 (21): Ivaṇṇo yaṃ navā

> Pubbo ivaṇṇo sare pare yakāraṃ pappoti navā.

> Paṭisunthāravutyassa,

> sabbā vityānubhūyate.

> Navāti kasmā?

> Pañcahaṅgehi samannāgato, muttacāgī anuddhato.

21: Like a boat that is new

A boat that was old becomes new when it gets a new yakāraṃ at the front and back.

Because of the thorough examination,

all the components are understood.

Why is it new?

It is endowed with the five components, released and unobstructed.

<a name="m22"></a>

### 22 (28): Evādissa ri pubbo ca rasso

> Saramhā parassa evassa ekārassa ādissa rikāro hoti, pubbo ca saro rasso hoti navā.

> Yathariva vasudhātalañca sabbaṃ,

> tathariva guṇavā supūjaniyo.

> Navāti kasmā?

> Yathā eva, tathā eva.

22 (28): Thus with "i" and the preceding (sound) being short

When "i" is before a single consonant of another (word), "r" is placed before it, and the preceding sound becomes short, it is new.

Just as the earth and all (else) are

to be honored in the same way as one of great virtue.

Why is it new?

Just as it is, so it is.

---

> _Iti sandhikappe dutiyo kaṇḍo._

### 22 (28): Thus with 'ri' initially and 'r' afterwards

When 'ri' with 'e' or 'o' is the initial, 'r' becomes 'rikāra', and the preceding sound becomes 'rassa' newly.

Like the earth and all else,

thus also is one who has virtues to be revered.

Why newly?

Just as it is, so it is.

_Thus the second chapter on sandhi._

### 23 (26): Sarā pakati byañjane

> Sarā kho byañjane pare pakatirūpāni honti.

> Manopubbaṅgamā dhammā,

> pamādo maccuno padaṃ,

> tiṇṇo pāraṅgato ahu.

23 (26): Sarā in Inherent Qualities

Inherent qualities are indeed the characteristics of qualities.

Mental precursors are the things,

heedlessness is the domain of death,

one who has crossed the flood is called.

---

<a name="m24"></a>

### 24 (35): Sare kvaci

> Sarā kho sare pare kvaci pakatirūpāni honti.

> Ko imaṃ pathaviṃ vicessati.

> Kvacīti kasmā?

> Appassutāyaṃ puriso.

24 (35): Sare kvaci

All sounds are sounds in some cases, naturally.

Who will distinguish this earth?

Why 'in some cases'?

Because the man is not learned.

### 25 (37): Dīghaṃ

> Kvacīti kasmā?

> Idha modati pecca modati,

> patilīyati,

> paṭihaññati.

## translation

### 25 (37): Long

Vowels, indeed, in some places become long after consonants.

While contemplating the right doctrine,

thus the sage wanders in the village,

patience is the highest asceticism, tolerance.

Why 'in some places'?

Here one delights, afterwards delights,

is pleased,

and rejoices.

---

<a name="m26"></a>

### 26 (38): Rassaṃ

> Sarā kho byañjane pare kvaci rassaṃ papponti.

> Bhovādināma so hoti,

> yathābhāvi guṇena so.

> Kvacīti kasmā?

> Sammāsamādhi,

> sāvittī chandaso mukhaṃ,

> upanīyati jīvitamappamāyu.

26 (38): Short (Rassaṃ)

The vowels are shortened in some places by the grammarians.

It becomes Bhovādin,

as it is, with the quality.

Why 'some places'?

Sammāsamādhi,

the beginning of the Sāvittī meter,

and the word 'jīvitamappamāyu'.

---

<a name="m27"></a>

### 27 (39): Lopañca tatrākāro

> Kvacīti kasmā?

> So muni,

> eso dhammo padissati,

> na so kāsāvamarahati.

### 27 (39): Lopañca tatrākāro

Vowels are indeed elided in some places after consonants. And when elision is done there, the augment of 'a' is added.

He is virtuous.

He is wise.

This Dhamma is eternal,

he wears worn-out robes,

he might even be a Brahmin,

he indeed is a sage who does not see fear of birth.

Why 'in some places'?

That sage,

this Dhamma will be proclaimed,

he does not wear worn-out robes.

## translation

### 28 (40): The Two States in the Locative

There are two states of the locative of another consonant.

For example,

of a man,

I will declare the going forth,

on the fourteenth, on the fifteenth,

the moon is past its zenith.

Why "in the locative"?

Here, he delights and afterwards delights.

29 (42): In a sentence, the third and fourth consonants of ghosāghosāna

In a sentence, indeed, the preceding consonants which are ghosāghosabhūtānaṃ, in sequence, according to their number, the third and fourth letters have a double nature in a place.

This is the result of spiritual cultivation,

where one stands,

death cannot overcome,

like a rock on the mountain peak,

a man who is heedless has four standings.

Why 'in a place'?

Because here the mind grasps firmly with thāmasā.

---

> _Iti sandhikappe tatiyo kaṇḍo._

### 29 (42): In a Section, the Third and Fourth of the Ghosāghosāna

In a section, indeed, of the preceding consonants which are ghosāghosabhūtānaṃ, two letters, according to their number, in the third and fourth place, go to two states in a position.

This is the result of neglect,

where death is standing,

death cannot be endured,

like a mountain standing on a rock,

a man is negligent in four positions.

Why 'in a position'?

Because here the mind grasps strongly due to thāmasā.

_Thus ends the third chapter on sandhi._

31 (49): At the End of a Section or in a Section

When a word that is a vowel or has a vowel sound at the end is followed by another word, the end of the section is indeed either cut off or elided.

Of one who has a steadfast mind,
who has good conduct in the pursuit of dhamma,
who has lived a long time as a man.
The mind of one who is consistent is compassionate,
this, monks, is to be learned.

The cutting off of the end of a word is not cut off by the mark of the syllable or the like.
The person.
Why is it cut off?
That action was not done well.

### 32 (50): Come

When the nasal sound is upon a single "ṃ" sound, the ñ sound is also obtained.

I will be fully enlightened by myself,
I will ask you about that,
this is how you should train, monks.
For that is his deception.

Why is it thus?

Having known thus,
the well-spoken word is thus.

### 34 (52): Madā sare

The consonants following a niggahita are pare, makāradakārādesā, if they exist.

I call him a brahmin,

thus the teacher spoke.

Why is it so?

You abused me, hindered me, beat me, and humiliated me.

35 (34): Ya va ma da na ta ra lā cāgamā

These āgamas are ya, va, ma, da, na, ta, ra, lā, and they can be either honti or vā.

Of this knowledge,
as the mind is thus.

The deer, sir, is frightened,
the seated ones will laugh at you,
the seated ones will honor you.

The good horse is like a plow,
for the fully understood and liberated.

For those liberated by understanding the mind,
having understood one's own benefit.

It delays for a long time,
it delays from this.

Whatever from that, monks,
whatever from that, monks,
the foot is placed on the ground.

All are brought together,
like a hare and a bird,
like a bird and a hare.

The six higher knowledges,
the six sense-spheres.

Why is it said?

Thus is the great power of this,

do not insult me, do not scold me, do not beat me, do not humiliate me,
I am unconquerable, a follower.

By the taking of c, the pakāra of makāra becomes here.

A man who has lived a long time.

The dakāra also becomes kakāra.

One who is skilled in the good.

The takāra also becomes dakāra,

the well-gone one.

### 37 (57): Niggahitañca

The word with niggahita is also an exception in the case of 's' or 'v' or elsewhere.

Eye-lid,
nose-hair,
as far as, monks, I remember my past births,
extremely small,
mind-preceded phenomena.

Why 'elsewhere'?

For here they praise the name,
and after death rejoice in heaven,
for with these vehicles one
would not go to an unvisited region.

The usage of 'c' is clear and the expression is also clear.

He will reach or he will investigate.

this is the doctrine of the Buddhas.

Sometimes, why?

This is the highest blessing,

Am I a fool now,
thus I think.

41 (56): A consonant is also without a perceptible object

When a consonant with a visible object is in another's domain, if the consonant is without a perceptible object.

Just like the residues,

the flowers arise.

Why is it said to be released?

Because it is known to be released thus.

By the elision of the three consonants, those similar ones in between are also elided.

In the non-home,

of the dependent on the paṭisanthāra.

41 (56): A consonant is also without a perceptible object

When a consonant with a visible object is in another place, if the consonant is without a perceptible object.

Just like the threads,

Why is it said to be cut off?

It is said because it is not understood.
