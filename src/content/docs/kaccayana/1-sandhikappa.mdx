### §1 (1): Attho akkharasaññāto (Meaning is represented by `akkhara`) :badge[sīhagatika]{variant=caution}

> [!NOTE]
> `akkhara` means “constant, durable, long-lasting” and in the context of Kaccāyana it means “sounds, tones, syllables of words” and also the units of the `abugida` (alpha-syllabary). It is derived from Akshara (Sanskrit: अक्षर, romanized: akṣara, lit. 'imperishable, indestructible, fixed, immutable'), a term used in the traditional grammar of the Sanskrit language and in the Vedanta school of Indian philosophy.

> Sabbavacanānamattho akkhareheva saññāyate.
>
> Akkharavipattiyaṃ hi atthassa dunnayathā hoti, tasmā akkharakosallaṃ bahūpakāraṃ suttantesu.

All meanings of words are based on the recognition of `akkhara`. A mistaken `akkhara` result in difficulty in interpreting meaning, therefore proficiency in `akkhara` is extremely helpful in (deciphering) the rules (or understanding the suttas in the Tipiṭaka).

> [!NOTE]
> An `abugida` is a segmental writing system in which consonant–vowel sequences are written as units; each unit is based on a consonant letter, and vowel notation is secondary, similar to a diacritical mark. This contrasts with a full alphabet, in which vowels have status equal to consonants.
>
> Pāḷi is generally written in a Brahmic script (also known as Indic script), which is an abugida writing system. Brahmic scripts are used throughout the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia and parts of East Asia. They are descended from the Brahmi script of ancient India. In the rest of this chapter, I use Brahmi as the writing system described by Kaccāyana. Brahmi is clearly attested from the 3rd century BCE during the reign of Ashoka, who used the script for imperial edicts.

### §3 (3): Tatthodantā sarā aṭṭha ([From `akkhara`] eight ending with `o`: `sara`) :badge[anvattha]{variant=note}

> [!NOTE]
> `sara` means "sound, voice, intonation, accent" and in the context of Kaccāyana it means "vowel". Vowels have independent existence, unlike consonants which need to be combined with vowels to make a sound.

> Tattha akkharesu akārādīsu odantā aṭṭha akkharā sarā nāma honti.

> Taṃ yathā?

> A ā i ī u ū e o, iti sarā nāma.

> Tena kvattho?

> Sarā sare lopaṃ.

Regarding the `akkhara`, the eight `akkhara` starting with `a` and ending with `o` are called `sarā` (vowels).

<LetterGrid letters={[["a", "ā", "i", "ī", "u", "ū", "e", "o"]]} />

> [!NOTE]
> The above symbols for the vowels are when they are used independently (ie. not attached or preceded by a consonant). If a vowel is attached to a consonant, the following diacritics are used:

  letters={[["(a)", "(ā)", "(i)", "(ī)", "(u)", "(ū)", "(e)", "(o)"]]}
/>

> [!TIP] Reference
> Refer to [§12 (13): sarā sare lopaṃ (vowel, before vowel, is elided)](#m12)

### §4 (4): Lahumattā tayo rassā (3 short vowels: `rassa`) :badge[anvattha]{variant=note}

> [!NOTE]
> `rassa` refers to a "short" vowel (with a metrical length of one morae, or approximately the time taken to blink the eyes).

> Tattha aṭṭhasu saresu lahumattā tayo sarā rassā nāma honti.

> Taṃ yathā?

> A i u, iti rassā nāma.

> Tena kvattho?

> Rassaṃ.

Regarding the eight vowels, the three short vowels are called `rassa`.

The `rassa` vowels are:

<LetterGrid letters={[["a", "i", "u"]]} />

---

<a name="m5"></a>

### §5 (5): Aññe dīghā (Other [`sarā`] are `dīgha`) :badge[anvattha]{variant=note}

> [!NOTE]
> `dīgha` refers to a "long" vowel (with a metrical length of two morae, or perhaps even longer).

> Tattha aṭṭhasu saresu rassehi aññe pañca sarā dīghā nāma honti.

> Taṃ yathā?

> Ā ī ū e o, iti dīghā nāma.

> Tena kvattho?

> Dīghaṃ.

Regarding the eight vowels, the five vowels other than the short vowels are called “digha.”

The digha vowels are:

> [!TIP] Reference
> Refer to [§25 (37): Dīghaṃ (long vowels)](#m25)

---

<a name="m6"></a>

### §6 (8): Sesā byañjanā (Remaining are `byañjanā`) :badge[anvattha]{variant=note}

> [!NOTE]
> `byañjana` means "attribute, sign, mark" and in the context of Kaccāyana it means "consonant", because consonants are "signs" that distinguish the units of a word. From a metrical perspective, they are regarded as having a length of half a morae.

> Ṭhapetvā aṭṭha sare sesā akkharā kakārādayo niggahitantā byañjanā nāma honti.

> Taṃ yathā?

> Ka kha ga gha ṅa, \
> ca cha ja jha ña, \

> pa pha ba bha ma, \
> ya ra la va sa ha ḷa aṃ,

> iti byañjanā nāma.

> Tena kvattho?

> Sarā pakati byañjane.

Having set aside the eight vowels, the (remaining) letters starting with `ka` and ending with the `niggahita` (`aṃ`) are named `byañjana` (consonants).

The byañjanā are:

<LetterGrid
  letters={[
    ["ka", "kha", "ga", "gha", "ṅa"],
    ["ca", "cha", "ja", "jha", "ña"],
    ["ṭa", "ṭha", "ḍa", "ḍha", "ṇa"],

    ["pa", "pha", "ba", "bha", "ma"],
    ["ya", "ra", "la", "va", "sa", "ha", "ḷa", "aṃ"],
  ]}
/>

> [!NOTE]
> Vowels following a consonant are inherent or written by diacritics. When no vowel is written, the vowel `a` is understood. For example the consonant `ka` can be combined with any of the diacritic vowels to form a syllable:

<LetterGrid
  letters={[
    ["(a)", "(ā)", "(i)", "(ī)", "(u)", "(ū)", "(e)", "(o)"],
    ["ka", "kā", "ki", "kī", "ku", "kū", "ke", "ko"],
  ]}
/>

### §7 (9): Vaggā pañcapañcaso mantā (`vagga`: 5 by 5 [byañjane] ending with `ma`) :badge[anvattha]{variant=note}

> [!NOTE]
> `vagga` means "group" or "series".

> Tesaṃ kho byañjanānaṃ kakārādayo makārantā pañcapañcaso akkharavanto vaggā nāma honti.

> Taṃ yathā?

> Ka kha ga gha ṅa, \

> ta tha da dha na, \
> pa pha ba bha ma,

> iti vaggā nāma.

> Tena kvattho?

> Vaggantaṃ vā vagge.

The consonants starting with `ka` and ending with `ma` arranged in five groups of five, are named `vagga` (grouped).

<LetterGrid
  letters={[
    ["ka", "kha", "ga", "gha", "ṅa"],
    ["ca", "cha", "ja", "jha", "ña"],
    ["ṭa", "ṭha", "ḍa", "ḍha", "ṇa"],
    ["ta", "tha", "da", "dha", "na"],
    ["pa", "pha", "ba", "bha", "ma"],
  ]}
/>

> [!TIP] Reference
> Refer to [§31 (49): Vaggantaṃ vā vagge (end-of-groups vs groups)](#m31)

<a name="m8"></a>

### §8 (10): Aṃ iti niggahitaṃ (`aṃ` represents `niggahita`) :badge[anvattha]{variant=note}

> [!NOTE]
> `niggahita` (lit. "held down") is a technical term referring to a nasalised after sound (Sanskrit: `anusvāra`) following a vowel. It is sometimes referred to as a vowel, but Kaccāyana classifies it as a consonant.

> Aṃ iti niggahitaṃ nāma hoti.

> Tena kvattho?

> Aṃ byañjane niggahitaṃ.

The `aṃ` letter is named `niggahita` (nasal consonant).

<LetterGrid letters={[["aṃ"]]} />

> [!NOTE]
> Note that the niggahita is also a diacritical mark appended to a consonant (possibly together with a vowel diacritic).

> [!TIP] Reference
> Refer to [§30 (58): Aṃ byañjane niggahitaṃ (“aṃ” in consonants: niggahita)](#m30)

### §9 (11): Parasamaññā payoge (Other grammatical terms when applicable) :badge[anvattha]{variant=note}

> Yā ca pana paresu sakkataganthesu samaññā ghosāti vā aghosāti vā, tā payoge sati etthāpi yujjante.

> Tattha ghosā nāma-

> ta tha, \
> pa pha, \
> sa,

> iti aghosā nāma.

> Tena kvattho?

> Vagge ghosāghosānaṃ tatiyapaṭhamā.

Terms such as `ghosa` (voiced) and `aghosa` (unvoiced) used in other texts (ie. Sanskrit grammar) are applicable here, keeping in mind when they are required to be used.

> [!NOTE]
> `ghosa` means "sound" and is used to refer to "sonants" (consonants voiced with "sonority") whereas `aghosa` is used to refer to "surds" (consonants pronounced with unintonated breath). Note that these are just two examples of Sanskrit technical terms that Kaccāyana says are applicable, others are used without definition, so Kaccāyana expects readers to be familiar with Sanskrit grammar.

`ghosā` letters:

<LetterGrid

    ["ga", "gha", "ṅa"],

### §10 (12): Pubbamadhoṭhita massaraṃ sarena viyojaye (In preceeding [word], detach vowel from vowelless [consonant]) :badge[vidhyanga]{variant=tip}

> [!NOTE]
> Note that this is a meta-operational rule that makes sense when referring to abugida scripts like Brahmi where the vowels (diacritics) are attached to consonants in each unit of a word. In Romanised Pāli, the vowels and consonants are represented by distinct letters so separating the vowel from the consonant is inherently done.

> Tattha sandhiṃ kattukāmo pubbabyañjanaṃ adhoṭhitaṃ assaraṃ katvā sarañca upari katvā sarena viyojaye.

> Tatrāyamādi.

In that regard, those wishing to make “sandhi” should detach the vowel(s) from the preceeding and succeeding consonants (end phoneme of preceeding word, and first phoneme of succeeding word).

Optionally, when a vowel not of the same type (of articulation) follows a vowel, the following vowel experience elision.

13 (15): Or the other is formless

The formless one obtains the disappearance of form or the other.

These four things, monks,

what are they, monk?

Why the "or"?

The five faculties,

those things are abandoned in him.

> Saro kho paro pubbasare lutte kvaci asavaṇṇaṃ pappoti.

> Saṅkhyaṃ nopeti vedagū,

> bandhusseva samāgamo.

> Kvacīti kasmā?

> Yassindriyāni,

> tathūpamaṃ dhammavaraṃ adesayi.

14 (16): Occasionally to the naked

A monk indeed, in the early morning, occasionally gets an impure color.

The sage does not reach a number,

the coming together is like a relative.

Why occasionally?

For one whose faculties are thus,

he teaches the excellent dhamma in like manner.

---

<a name="m15"></a>

### 15 (17): Dīghaṃ

> Saro kho paro pubbasare lutte kvaci dīghaṃ pappoti.

> Saddhīdha vittaṃ purisassa seṭṭhaṃ,

> anāgārehi cūbhayaṃ.

> Kvacīti kasmā?

> Pañcahupāli aṅgehi samannāgato.

> Natthaññaṃ kiñci.

15 (17): Dīghaṃ

A particle indeed, in the previous period, when elided, sometimes becomes long.

Faith is the wealth of a man, the best,

in both laymen and monks.

Why 'sometimes'?

Because it is provided with five exceptions.

There is nothing else.

---

<a name="m16"></a>

### 16 (18): Pubbo ca

> Kiṃsūdha vittaṃ purisassa seṭṭhaṃ,

> sādhūti paṭissuṇitvā,

> kvacīti kasmā?

> Itissa muhuttampi.

16 (18): Pubbo ca

Previously, a vowel and a consonant having been combined, sometimes a long (vowel) is obtained.

What is the wealth of a man, the best?

Having answered "good speech",

where is "sometimes"?

For a moment, of such a man.

### 17 (19): Yamedantassādeso

> Ekārassa antabhūtassa sare pare kvaci yakārādeso hoti.

> tyāhaṃ evaṃ vadeyyaṃ,

> tyāssa pahīnā honti.

> Kvacīti kasmā?

> Ne’nāgatā,

> iti nettha.

17 (19): Yamedantassādeso

Of the internal ekāra that has become the end, sometimes the yakāra substitution occurs.

This doctrine has been understood by me,

thus I would speak,

thus those are abandoned by him.

Sometimes, why?

Because they are not to be come,

thus it is not so.

<a name="m18"></a>

### 18 (20): Vamodudantānaṃ

> vatthvettha vihitaṃ niccaṃ cakkhāpāthamāgacchati.

> Kvacītikasmā?

> Cattāro’me bhikkhave dhammā,

> kinnumāva samaṇiyo.

### 18 (20): Vamodudantānaṃ

Of the Okārukārānaṃ that have become internal, sometimes the substitute of "va" is found at the end.

Then indeed,

it is its own,

there is much danger,

the constant eye-salve prescribed for the skin is applied.

From what reason?

These four things, monks,

are like a ascetic.

<a name="m19"></a>

### 19 (22): Sabbo caṃti

> Sabbo icceso tisaddo byañjano sare pare kvaci cakāraṃ pappoti.

> Iccetaṃ kusalaṃ, iccassa vacanīyaṃ, paccuttaritvā, paccāharati.

> Kvacīti kasmā?

> Itissa muhuttampi.

19 (22): Sabbo caṃti

Everything is called a word when three sounds or a vowel and a consonant and a visarga are obtained somewhere.

It is called "iccessa" when it is good, "iccessa" is to be spoken, having answered, having brought.

Why "somewhere"?

Because of (the word) "itissa" for a moment.

<a name="m20"></a>

### 20 (27): Do dhassa ca

> Dhaiccetassa sare pare kvaci dakārādeso hoti.

> Ekamidāhaṃ bhikkhave samayaṃ.

> Kvacīti kasmā?

> Idheva maraṇaṃ bhavissati.

> Vaggahaṇena dhakārassa hakārādeso hoti sāhu dassana mariyānaṃ.

> Suttavibhāgena bahudhā siyā-

> To dassa, yathā? Sugato.

> Cco ttassa, yathā bhacco.

> Pho passa, yathā? Nipphatti.

> Kho kassa, yathā? Nikkhamati.

> Iccevamādī yojetabbā.

20 (27): Of dhassa also

For dhaiccetassa, in some cases, the substitute dakāra is used.

There is one instance, monks.

Why 'in some cases'?

Here death will occur.

By the rule of substitution, the substitute hakāra is used for dhakāra, as seen in the example of death.

In the analysis of the sutta, it becomes many -

What is that instance, namely? The Sugato.

What is that of it, namely? Dukkaṭaṃ.

What is its dh, namely? Gandhabbo.

What is its tr, namely? Atrajo.

What is its k, namely? Kulūpako.

What is its l, namely? Mahāsālo.

What is its j, namely? Gavajo.

What is its bb, namely? Kubbato.

What is its k, namely? Sake.

What is its y, namely? Niyaṃputtaṃ.

What is its k, namely? Niyako.

What is its cc, namely? Bhacco.

What is its ph, namely? Nipphatti.

What is its kh, namely? Nikkhamati.

Such and similar ones should be connected.

> Navāti kasmā?

> Pañcahaṅgehi samannāgato, muttacāgī anuddhato.

21: Like a boat that is new

A boat that was old becomes new when it gets a new yakāraṃ at the front and back.

Because of the thorough examination,

all the components are understood.

Why is it new?

It is endowed with the five components, released and unobstructed.

> tathariva guṇavā supūjaniyo.

> Navāti kasmā?

> Yathā eva, tathā eva.

22 (28): Thus with "i" and the preceding (sound) being short

When "i" is before a single consonant of another (word), "r" is placed before it, and the preceding sound becomes short, it is new.

Just as the earth and all (else) are

to be honored in the same way as one of great virtue.

Why is it new?

Just as it is, so it is.

---

> _Iti sandhikappe dutiyo kaṇḍo._

### 22 (28): Thus with 'ri' initially and 'r' afterwards

When 'ri' with 'e' or 'o' is the initial, 'r' becomes 'rikāra', and the preceding sound becomes 'rassa' newly.

Like the earth and all else,

thus also is one who has virtues to be revered.

Why newly?

Just as it is, so it is.

_Thus the second chapter on sandhi._

23 (26): Sarā in Inherent Qualities

Inherent qualities are indeed the characteristics of qualities.

Mental precursors are the things,

heedlessness is the domain of death,

one who has crossed the flood is called.

24 (35): Sare kvaci

All sounds are sounds in some cases, naturally.

Who will distinguish this earth?

Why 'in some cases'?

Because the man is not learned.

## translation

### 25 (37): Long

Vowels, indeed, in some places become long after consonants.

While contemplating the right doctrine,

thus the sage wanders in the village,

patience is the highest asceticism, tolerance.

Why 'in some places'?

Here one delights, afterwards delights,

is pleased,

and rejoices.

### 26 (38): Rassaṃ

26 (38): Short (Rassaṃ)

The vowels are shortened in some places by the grammarians.

It becomes Bhovādin,

as it is, with the quality.

Why 'some places'?

Sammāsamādhi,

the beginning of the Sāvittī meter,

and the word 'jīvitamappamāyu'.

### 27 (39): Lopañca tatrākāro

Vowels are indeed elided in some places after consonants. And when elision is done there, the augment of 'a' is added.

He is virtuous.

He is wise.

This Dhamma is eternal,

he wears worn-out robes,

he might even be a Brahmin,

he indeed is a sage who does not see fear of birth.

Why 'in some places'?

That sage,

this Dhamma will be proclaimed,

he does not wear worn-out robes.

There are two states of the locative of another consonant.

Why "in the locative"?

Here, he delights and afterwards delights.

29 (42): In a sentence, the third and fourth consonants of ghosāghosāna

In a sentence, indeed, the preceding consonants which are ghosāghosabhūtānaṃ, in sequence, according to their number, the third and fourth letters have a double nature in a place.

This is the result of spiritual cultivation,

where one stands,

death cannot overcome,

like a rock on the mountain peak,

a man who is heedless has four standings.

Why 'in a place'?

Because here the mind grasps firmly with thāmasā.

---

> _Iti sandhikappe tatiyo kaṇḍo._

### 29 (42): In a Section, the Third and Fourth of the Ghosāghosāna

In a section, indeed, of the preceding consonants which are ghosāghosabhūtānaṃ, two letters, according to their number, in the third and fourth place, go to two states in a position.

This is the result of neglect,

where death is standing,

death cannot be endured,

like a mountain standing on a rock,

a man is negligent in four positions.

Why 'in a position'?

Because here the mind grasps strongly due to thāmasā.

_Thus ends the third chapter on sandhi._

31 (49): At the End of a Section or in a Section

When a word that is a vowel or has a vowel sound at the end is followed by another word, the end of the section is indeed either cut off or elided.

Of one who has a steadfast mind,
who has good conduct in the pursuit of dhamma,
who has lived a long time as a man.
The mind of one who is consistent is compassionate,
this, monks, is to be learned.

The cutting off of the end of a word is not cut off by the mark of the syllable or the like.
The person.
Why is it cut off?
That action was not done well.

These āgamas are ya, va, ma, da, na, ta, ra, lā, and they can be either honti or vā.

Of this knowledge,
as the mind is thus.

The deer, sir, is frightened,
the seated ones will laugh at you,
the seated ones will honor you.

The good horse is like a plow,
for the fully understood and liberated.

For those liberated by understanding the mind,
having understood one's own benefit.

It delays for a long time,
it delays from this.

Whatever from that, monks,
whatever from that, monks,
the foot is placed on the ground.

All are brought together,
like a hare and a bird,
like a bird and a hare.

The six higher knowledges,
the six sense-spheres.

Why is it said?

Thus is the great power of this,

do not insult me, do not scold me, do not beat me, do not humiliate me,
I am unconquerable, a follower.

By the taking of c, the pakāra of makāra becomes here.

A man who has lived a long time.

The dakāra also becomes kakāra.

One who is skilled in the good.

The takāra also becomes dakāra,

the well-gone one.

The word with niggahita is also an exception in the case of 's' or 'v' or elsewhere.

Eye-lid,

extremely small,
mind-preceded phenomena.

Why 'elsewhere'?

For here they praise the name,
and after death rejoice in heaven,

would not go to an unvisited region.

The usage of 'c' is clear and the expression is also clear.
