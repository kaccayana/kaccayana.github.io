## PREFACE

The Bālāvatāra, originally edited for use in the upper classes of High English Schools by the late Mahamahopadhyaya Dr. Satischandra Vidyabhusana and the late Samana Punnananda Swami, has been revised and recast in the present edition. The sutras of the *Nāmakanda* have been omitted altogether because they often proved boring to the beginner, but the matter in that section has been re-shuffled and conveniently arranged. New topics — *Samāsa*, *Kāraka* and *Vibhatti-bheda* — have been added for the simple reason that they are essential at the preliminary stage. As Vernacular has been made the medium of instruction for the Matriculation Examination in subjects other than English, I have deemed it desirable to explain the sutras in Bengali without, however, omitting the old exposition in English. Considerable additions have been made to the illustrations, for which I have drawn very largely upon Kaccāyana.

A word of explanation is, I believe, necessary in regard to the *Case* (*Vibhatti*). According to indigenous grammarians, the  Vibhattis are seven, excluding the *Ālapana*, which in English grammar is distinguished as a Case, *i.e.*, the Case of Address. In order, however, not to confound the beginner (whose knowledge of English grammar is presupposed) by stating at the outset that the Vocative is not regarded as an independent case, I have preferred, as will be seen at page 31, to count the cases as eight (including the Vocative), leaving the student's notion to be gradually cleared as he reaches the sections on Kāraka and Vibhatti-bheda.

My thanks are due to Mr. Atulchandra Ghatak, M.A., Superintendent of the University Press, for the ready assistance he has given in seeing the book through the press.

## I SAÑÑĀ (Orthography)

### 1.[^1] Akkharāpādayo ekacattālīsaṃ.

[^1]: These figures refer to the Book, the Chapter and the Sfitra respectively of Kaccāyana’s Pāli Grammar, to which the Bālāvtāra
Sūtra can be traced.

The letters beginning with a are forty-one, useful
to Suttanta.

* They are:\
  a ā i ī u ū e o,\
  k, kh, g, gh, ṅ,\
  c, ch, j, jh, ñ,\
  ṭ, ṭh, ḍ, ḍh, ṇ,\
  t, th, d, dh, n,\
  p, ph, b, bh, m,\
  y, r, l, v, s, h, ḷ, and ṃ.

### 3. Tatthodantāsarā aṭṭha.

Of them, the first eight letters ending with *o* are
Vowels.

* They are:\
  a, ā, i, ī, u, ū, e and o.

* [These are classified in the following two suttas.]

### 4. Lahumattā tayo rassā.

The three of soft measure are **short** (vowels).

* Of the vowels, the three of soft measure, viz.,
  a, i, u are short.

### 5. Aññe dīghā.

The rest are **long**.

* The vowels other than the short ones are long,
  e.g., *ā*, *ī*, *ū*, *e* and *o*. But *e* and *o* preceding
  combined consonants are sometimes regarded as
  short vowels.

* [By ‘combined consonants’ are meant consonants without any vowel intervening them.]

* The examples of *e* and *o* regarded as short vowels
are:

  * *e* in *ettha* and *seyyo*;
  * *o* in *oṭṭho* and *sotthi*.

### 5. Sesā byañjanā.

The remaining letters are **Consonants**.

* Setting aside the vowels, the other thirty-three
  letters, from *k* to *ṃ*, are consonants.

* The Consonants аге:\
  k, kh, g, gh, ṅ,\
  c, ch, j, jh, ñ,\
  ṭ, ṭh, ḍ, ḍh, ṇ,\
  t, th, d, dh, n,\
  p, ph, b, bh, m,\
  y, r, l, v, s, h, ḷ, ṃ.

### б. Vaggā pañcapañcaso mantā.

The **Vaggas** are groups of five of the first
twenty-five consonants ending with *m*.

* Of the consonants, the first twenty-five, from
  k to m, are arranged in five groups, each consisting
  of five letters.\
  *ka*-vagga - k, kh, g, gh, ṅ;\
  *ca*-vagga - c, ch, j, jh, ñ;\
  *ṭa*-vagga - ṭ, ṭh, ḍ, ḍh, ṇ;\
  *ta*-vagga - t, th, d, dh, n;\
  *pa*-vagga - p, ph, b, bh, m.

* The first and second letters оf each Vagga,
  together with *s*, are called **Āghosa** or **Surds**. The
  remaining letters ending with *ḷ* are **Ghosa**[^2] or
  **Sonants**.

* The *Surds* are:\
  k, kh, c, ch, ṭ, ṭh, t, th, p, ph and s.

* The *Sonants* аге:\
  g, gh, ṅ, j, jh, ñ, ḍ, ḍh, ṇ, d, dh, n, b, bh, y, r, l, v, h, and ḷ.

### 7. Aṃiti niggahītaṃ.

*Ṃ* is Niggahita.

* The nasal denoted by *ṃ*, which is sounded
  after *a* (in the syllable *aṃ*), is called **Niggahita**
  (arrested letter).[^3]

* The vowels *i* and *u* may also be placed before
  it, but not any other vowel.

[^2]: The technical terms **Ghosa** and **Āghosa** have been taken from
Sanskrit Grammar, as is indicated in the Sutta *“parasamaññā payoge"* (*vide* Kaccāyana, 1. 9). Other terms have been similarly borrowed, e.g. **liṅga**, **sabbanāma**, **pada**, **upasagga**, **nipāta**, etc.

[^3]: The following verse gives a full definition of Niggahita : Bindu cūḷā-maṇ'-ākāro Niggahitan ti vuccate | Kevalass' appayogattā a-kāro sannidhīyate || *i.e.*, The point resembling a small gem is called **Niggahita**, As it is not employed alone, *a* is placed before it.

* The letters of the alphabet can be grouped,
  according to their seats of pronunciation
  as follows : —\
  *a*, *ā*, *h*, and *ka*-vagga are Gutturals.\
  *i*, *ī*, *y*, and *ca*-vagga are Palatals.\
  *u*, *ū*, and *pa*-vagga are Labials.\
  *r*; *ḷ* and *ṭa*-vagga are Linguals.\
  *l*, *s*, and *ta*-vagga are Dentals.\
  *e* is Gutturo-Palatal.\
  *o* is Gutturo-Labial.\
  *v* is Dento-Labial.

## II SARA-SANDHI (Vowel-Junction)

**Sandhi** (Junction) means proximity of two
letters without any other letter or pause intervening them.

### 1. Sarā sare lopaṃ.

There is elision of a vowel before a vowel.

* A vowel immediately followed by a vowel is
  elided, as
  * loka + aggo = lok’aggo.

* [There is no vowel-sandhi, if there is,
  intervention of
  1. a consonant, as in
     * Maṃ + ahāsi = Maṃ ahāsi\
     (here *a* is not joined with *a*, because
     of *ṃ* intervening),

     or

  2. a pause in metre (on
     account of which the 2nd foot is not joined with
     the 3rd), as in the following Gāthā:

      >"Pamādamanuyuñjanti\
      >bālā dummedhino janā\
      >Appamādañca medhāvī\
      >dhanaṃ seṭṭhaṃ va rakkhati."

     * Janā + appamādaṃ = janā + appamādaṃ,\
       where *ā* of the second foot has not been joined with *a* of
       the third foot on account of a pause after the *ā* of
       "janā".

  Such is the case in all Sandhis.]

### 2. Vā paro asarūpo.

There is optional elision of a vowel after a
dissimilar vowel.

* A vowel after a dissimilar vowel is optionally
  elided:
  * Pana + ime = Pana‘mе, Pan’ime.

### 3. Kvacāsavaṇṇaṃ lutte.

In case of elision, the succeeding vowel sometimes
becomes dissimilar.

* If the preceding vowel is elided, the succeeding
  vowel is sometimes changed into a dissimilar
  vowel, so that *i* and *u* are respectively changed into
  *e* and *o* owing to the affinity of their pronunciation:\
  * Bandhussa + iva = Bandhuss’eva. (So also *ī*
    is changed into *o*.)
  * Na + upeti = N’opeti. (So also *ā* is changed
    into *o*.)

### 4. Dīghaṃ.

There is lengthening of the succeeding vowel.

* If the preceding vowel is elided, the succeeding
  vowel is sometimes lengthened :

  * tatra + ayaṃ = tatr'āyaṃ
  * yāni + idha = yān'īdha
  * bahu + upakāraṃ = bah'ūpakāraṃ
  * saddhā + idha = saddh'īdha
  * tathā + upamaṃ = tath'ūpamaṃ

### 5. Pūbbo[^4] ca.

There is lengthening of the preceding vowel.

* If the succeeding vowel is elided, the preceding
  vowel is sometimes lengthened :
  * kiṃsu + idha = kiṃsūdha

[^4]: The word is alwaya spelt with a short *u* in Pāli (*vide* Sutta 10,
р. 14). I have left the spelling just as it occurs in manuscripts.

### б. Yamedantassādeso.

The final *e* is changed into *y*.

* The final *e* (of the preceding word) followed.
  by a dissimilar vowel is sometimes changed
  into *y*:

  * te + ajja = tyajja

* But,
  * te + ahaṃ = tyāhaṃ.

  [Here *a* is lengthened,
  because "a vowel followed by a consonant is some-
  times lengthened" (*vide* Kaccāyana, 1. 3. 8).]

### 7. Vamodudantānaṃ.

The final *o* and *u* are changed into *v*.

* The final *o* and *u* (of the preceding word)
  followed by a (dissimilar) vowel are sometimes
  changed into *v*:

  * so + assa = svassa
  * anu + eti = anveti

* But,
  * tayo + assu = tay'assu
  * sametu + āyasmā = samet'āyasmā

### 8. Do dhassa ca.

*Dh* is sometimes changed into *d*.

* If a vowel follows, *dh* is sometimes changed
  into *d*:
  * idha + ahaṃ = idāhaṃ,

    [Here *a* of "ahaṃ" is
    lengthened, because the preceding *a* is elided
    (*vide* Sutta 4 above).]

* But,
  * idha + eva = idh’eva.

* Even when followed by a consonant, *dh* is
  sometimes changed into *d* :
  * idha + bhikkhave = ida bhikkhave.

### 9. Ivaṇṇo yannavā.

*I* and *ī* may or may not be changed into *у*.

* If a (dissimilar) vowel follows, the preceding
  letters *i* and *ī* may or may not be changed
  into *y*:
  * vutti + assa = vutyassa.

* [If there is *ty*, it is
  sometimes changed into *cc*; as,
  * pati + antuṃ = patyantaṃ = paccantaṃ.]
* But,
  * pati + aggi = paṭaggi.

    [Here *t* becomes *ṭ*
    by the sutta ‘‘ Pati patisseti'" (*vide* Kaccayana, 1. 5. 7).]

* The word "vaṇṇo" is used to include in all
  cases both short and long vowels; for instance, the
  "vaṇṇa a" implies both *a* and *ā* ; the "vaṇṇa i"
  implies both *i* and *ī*; and the "vaṇṇa u" implies
  both *u* and *ū*.

### 10.  Evādissa ri pubbo ca rasso.

*E* of *eva* is optionally changed into *ri*, and the
preceding vowel is shortened.

* If *eva* follows a vowel, the *e* of *eva* may
  optionally be changed into *ri*, and the preceding
  vowel into its corresponding short formi:

  * Yathā + eva=yathariva, yath' eva:

### 11.  Yavamadanataralà cagama.

*Y*, *v*, *m*, *d*, *n*, *t*, *r*, апd *ḷ* are the optional
*insertions*.

* When a vowel follows, the letters *y*, *v*, *m*, *d*,
  *n*, *t*, *r*, апd *ḷ* may be optionally inserted. *G* also
  may come as an insertion:

  * na + imassa = na-y-imassa
  * ti + aṅgikaṃ = ti-v-aṅgikaṃ
  * lahu + essati = lahu-m-essati
  * atta + atthaṃ = atta-d-atthaṃ
  * ito + āyati = ito-n-āyati
  * tasmā + iha = tasmā-t-iha
  * sabbhi + eva = sabbhi-r-eva
  * cha + abhiññā = cha-ḷ-abhiñā (Sometimes
    there is no sandhi.)
* And, putha + eva = putha-g-eva (Sometimes
  there is no sandhi.)
* Also, pā + eva = pa-g-eva (Sometimes
* But, abhi + uggato = abbhuggato.

## III. BYANJANA-SANDHI (Consonant-Junction)

In the following suttas the words *byañjane* ('when
a consonant follows') and *kvacit* ('sometimes') are
understood.

### 1. Lopañca tatrākāro

There is elision of the vowel, with an insertion of
*a* in its place.

* A vowel followed by a consonant is sometimes
  elided and *a* is inserted in its place:
  * So + bhikkhu=sa bhikkhu.
* *U* and *o* may also come аз insertions:
  * Jānema + taṃ = jānemu taṃ.
  * Kaccinu + tvaṃ = kaccino tvaṃ.
* But, So + muni=so muni (without Sandhi).

### 2. Vagge ghosāghosānaṃ tatiya-paṭhamā.

The *sonant* and *surd* consonants of a *vagga* get
doubled by taking before them the third and
the first letter respectively of the vagga.

* The fourth and the second lettera of a vagga
  after a vowel are in some instances doubled
  through conjunction with the third and the first
  letter respectively of the vagga:
  * U + ghoso = ugghoso.
  * Ā + khātaṃ = akkhātaṃ. [Here *ā* is
    shortened according to the  Knccayana sutta
    "Rassaṁ" (1. З. 4), which lays down: “A vowel
    followed by а consonant is sometimes shortened."]

* Exceptions : —

  1. *O* is sometimes inserted when a consonant
     follows :
     * Para + sahassaṃ = parosahassaṃ.
     * Atippa + kho = atippagokho.
       [There is insertion of *o* here after *g* has been added according
       to the sutta "Yavamadanataraḷā cāgamā" (pp. 14, 15).]
  2. *Ava* is sometimes changed into *o* when a
     consonant follows:
     * Ava + naddhā = onaddhā.
     * But, Ava + sussatu = avasussatu.

## IV. NIGGAHĪTA[^5]-SANDHI (Nasal-Junction)

[^5]: See p. 5, sutta 1.7, where the word is spelt with a short *i*.

### 1. Vaggantaṃ vā vagge.

The *Niggahīta* followed by a consonant of a vagga
is optionally transformed into the last consonant of that vagga.

* *Ṁ* followed by a consonant of a vagga is
  optionally changed into the last consonant of the
  same vagga :

  * Kiṃ + kato = kiṅkato.
  * Saṃ + jāto = sañjāto.
  * Saṃ + ṭhito = saṇṭhito.
  * Taṃ + dhanaṃ = tandhanaṃ.
  * Taṃ + mittaṃ = tammittaṃ.

* But, Na + taṃ + kammaṃ = nataṃkammaṃ
  (without Sandhi).

* *Ṁ* may be changed into *l* when followed
  bу a *l*:
  * Puṃ + liṅgaṃ = pulliṅgaṃ.
Pum + lingam = Pullingarn.

### 2. Madā sare.

[The *Niggahīta* is optionally changed into] *m* or *d*
if a vowel follows.

* *Ṁ* followed by a vowel is sometimes optionally
  changed into *m* or *d*:

  * Evaṃ + assa = eva + (ṃ→m + a) + ssa = evamassa
  * Etaṃ + avoca = eta + (ṃ→d + a) + voca = etadavoca

* But, Maṃ + ajini = maṃajini.

### 3. Eheñaṃ.

When *e* or *h* follows, [the *Niggahīta* is optionally
changed into] *ñ*.

* *Ṁ* followed by *e* or *h* is optionally changed
  into *ñ*:

  * Taṃ + eva = taññeva [the doubling of *ñ* takes
    place according to the Кассāуапа sutta
    "Paradvebhāvo ṭhāne" (1. 3. 6)]; also, —
    tameva.
  * taṃ + hi = tañhi ; also, — taṃhi (without
    Sandhi).

### 4. Saye ca.

The *Niggahīta* together with *y*, which follows, is
also optionally changed into *ñ*.

* Even when followed by *y*, the *ṁ* together
  with the *y* is optionally changed into *ñ*:

  * saṃyogo = saññogo [ the doubling of *ñ*
  takes place according to the Кассауапа
  sutta (1. 3. 6), quoted above] ; also,—
  saṃyogo.

### 5. Niggahītañca.

The Niggahīta is also [sometimes optionally]
inserted.

* *Ṁ* is also sometimes optionally inserted when
  a vowel or a consonant follows:

  * Cakkhu + aniccaṃ = cakkhuṃaniccaṃ.
  * Ava + siro =  avaṃsiro.

* [The opposite is also noticeable (*vide* Kaccāyana,
  1.4.9 "Kvaci lopaṁ") :

  1. *Ṁ* is sometimes elided when a vowel follows:

     * Vidūnaṃ + aggaṃ = vidūna + aggaṃ = vidūnaggaṃ
     * Tāsaṃ + ahaṃ = tāsa + ahaṃ = tāsāhaṃ
       (Here, the second vowel of tāsāhaṃ is
       lengthened according to the sutta
       "Dighaṁ" see *ante*, p. 10, sutta 4.)

  2. There is occasional elision even when a
     consonant follows:

     * Buddhānaṃ + sāsanaṃ = buddhāna + sāsanaṃ = buddhānasāsanaṃ
     * Saṃ + rāgo = sa + rāgo = sārāgo (For the
       lengthening of the first vowel of sārāgo,
       *vide* Kaccāyana, 1.8.3, — "Dighaṁ.")]

### 6. Paro vā saro.

The succeeding vowel is sometimes optionally
elided.

* Sometimes the vowel after *ṁ* is optionally
  elided :
  * Bījaṃ + iva = bījaṃ va.

### 7. Byañjano ca visaññogo.

The consonant is also simplified.

* When the vowel is elided after *ṁ*, the succeeding conjunct is simplified :
  * Evaṃ + assa = evaṃ + 'ssa = evaṃ 'sa.

## V. VOMISSAKA-SANDHI (Miscellaneous Junction)

### 1. Anupadiṭṭhānaṃ vuttayogato.

The foregoing suttas are to be suitably applied to
instances not yet discussed.

* The foregoing suttas of vowel-junction and
  consonant-junction are to be applied in a suitable
  manner to the prefix, indeclinable and other
  kinds of junction, not yet discussed :

* For instance, yadi + evaṃ =  yadj + evaṃ =
  yajjevaṃ — (first, by the sutta "Ivaṇṇo yannavā"
  (see ante, p. 13), *di* of *yadi* is changed
  into *dy*; secondly, by the principle (implied in the
  same sutta) that "*ty* is sometimes changed into
  *cc*," *dy* is changed into *jj*). Similarly,
  Bodhi + aṅgā =  bodhy + aṅgā = bojjhaṅgā.]

The following minor rules are applicable in
Miscellaneous Junction :—

1. Asadisa-saṃyoge ekasarūpatā ca.

   * In junction, the preceding consonant is assimilated
     to the succeeding dissimilar consonant:
     * Pari + esanā = pary + esanā (vide sutta 9, р. 18) =
       payyesanā (*r* being assimilated
       to *y*).

2. Vaṇṇānaṃ bahuttaṃ, viparītatā ca.

   * In some cases there is multiplication of a
     letter, and in certain cases there is inversion too.
     For instance,

   * In sa + rati = sumarati, there are insertion of
     *ma* (II. 11) and transformation of *a* into *u* (III. 1).

   * In iti + evaṁ = itvevaṁ, there is transformation
     of *i* into *v* by extension of sutta II. 7 (p. 11).

   * In sā + itthi = sotthi, the succeeding vowel *i*
     having been elided, the preceding *ā* is changed
     into *o* by extension of sutta II. 5 (p. 10).

   * In  busā + eva = busamiva, *m* іs inserted
     (11. 11), the preceding vowel *ā* is shortened (*vide*
     Kaccüyana, 1. 3. 4. - "Rassaṁ") and the succeeding
     *e* is changed into *i* by extension of sutta
     II. 10 (p. 14).

   * In bahu + ābādho = bavhābādho, *u* being followed
     by the dissimilar vowel *ā* is first changed
     into *v* (II. 7), and then there is inversion
     between and v.

   * In adhi + abhavi = addhābhavi, there is application
     of the principle according to which "adhi
     is sometimes changed into addha," and of
     sutta II. 4 (p. 10), which lays down, “If the
     preceding vowel is elided, the succeeding vowel
     is sometimes lengthened.”

3. Radānaṃ ḷo.

   * *R* and *d* are changed into *ḷ*:—

     * Pari + bodho = paḷibodho.
     * Pari + dāho = pariḷāho.

4. Sare, byañjane vā pare binduno kvaci mo.

   * If a vowel ог a consonant follows, *ṁ* is
     sometimes changed into *m* :
     * Maṃ + ahāsi = mamahāsi (*vide* sutta IV. 2) ;
     * Buddhaṃ + saraṇaṃ = buddham saraṇaṃ.

5. Binduto parasarāna maññassaratāpi.

   * The vowels after *ṁ* may be changed into
     dissimilar vowels:

     * Taṃ + iminā = tadaminā — (*i* is changed into *a*,
       after *ṁ* has been replaced by *d* according to sutta
       IV. 2).

     * Evaṃ + imaṃ = evumaṃ — (*ṁ* is elided, according
       to the Kaccāyana sutta "Kvaci lopaṁ" 1.4.9,
       and then *i* is changed into *u*.

     * Kiṃ + ahaṃ = kehaṃ - (*ṁ* is elided, and *i* is
       changed into *e*).

6. Vākyasukhuccāraṇatthaṃ, chandahānitthañca vaṇṇalopopi.

   * Letters are sometimes omitted for the sake of
     euphony and metre :

   * Paṭisaṁkhāya + yoniso = paṭisaṁkhā'yoniso
     — (the preceding *ya* is elided for the sake of
     euphony).

   * Alāpūni + sīdanti = 'lāpūni sīdanti
     — (the initial *a*
     of *alābūni* is elided on account of the exigency of
     metre).

2. Vutyabhedāya vikāropi.

   * There is exception even to the above sub-rule
     for the sake of metre:[^6]

   * Akaramhase te = akaramhasa te - (the long
     vowel *e* of *se* is changed into the short vowel *a*,
     *metri causa*).

[^6]: Akkharaniyamo *Chandaṁ*, garū-lahu-niyamo bhave *Vutti*,\
Digho saṁyogādi-pubbo rasso ca *garū*, *lahu* tu rasso.\
**Metre** is the harmonious order of letters. **Measure** is the regulation
of heavy and light vowels.\
A *heavy* vowel is a long vowel, and so is also the short vowel which
precedes a double consonant or the *Niggahīta*; e.g., the italics in the
following :— *ā*, *аssa*, *aṁ*.\
A *light* vowel is a short vowel; e.g., the vowels *a*, *i* and *u*.

## VI. NĀMAKANDO (Name)

1. Words are chiefly divided into *two* classes,
   — **Name** and **Verb**.

2. Name comprises Noun, Pronoun (including
   the Numerals), Preposition and the Indeclinable.

3. There are *three* Genders :— Masculine, Feminine and Neuter.

4. There are *two* Numbers :— Singular and
   Plural.

5. There are *eight* Cases (including the
   *Vocative*) :- *Paṭhamā* or the First Case
   (Nominative), *Dutiyā*, the Second Case
   (Accusative), *Tatiyā*, the Third Case (Instrumental),
   *Catutthī*, the Fourth (Dative),
   *Раñсаmī*, the Fifth (Ablative), *Chaṭṭhī*, the
   Sixth (Genitive), *Sattamī*, the Seventh (Locative),
   апd *Ālapana* or the Case of Address ( Vocative).
   In derivation the last one is not distinguished from the Paṭhamā, although it is
   apparently different in the Singular number.

6. Case-endings are added to the **Linga** or
   crude form of a word (which is also called its
   **Stem** or **Base**), according to the particular
   relation in which we intend to use it.

   * The case-endings are set in order as follows :—

     |                             | *Singular* | *Plural* |
     | --------------------------- | ---------- | -------- |
     | 1st — Paṭhamā (Nominative)  | si         | yo       |
     | Ālapana (Vocative)          | si *or* ga | yo       |
     | 2nd — Dutiyā (Accusative)   | aṁ         | yo       |
     | 3rd — Tatiyā (Instrumental) | nā         | hi       |
     | 4th — Catutthī (Dative)     | ва         | naṁ      |
     | 5th — Раñсаmī (Ablative)    | smā        | hi       |
     | 6th — Chaṭṭhī (Genitive)    | ва         | naṁ      |
     | 7th — Sattamī (Locative)    | smiṁ       | su       |

     A stem is said to be **declined**, when the
     case-endings are stuck to it. The case-endings
     undergo change in some instances, as can be seen
     from the declension of the stem *Buddha*, given
     below :—

     |          | *Singular*                          | *Plural*                |

     | Sattamī  | Buddh*e*, Buddh*asmiṁ*, Buddh*amhi* | Buddh*esu*              |

7. **Stems** are crude forms of words which are
   neither roots, nor verbal terminations, nor
   case-endings, but which yet convey a certain
   meaning; for instance, when we merely say
   *Buddha*, the term signifies neither the root
   *budh* from which it is derived, nor any verbal
   termination; nor, again, has any case-ending
   been added to it, giving it the bearing of the
   nominative or the accusative or the instrumental
   and so on. Nevertheless, it means
   some one named ' Buddha,’ but not yet in any
   particular relation to any person, action or
   thing, and'as such it is merely a nominal *stem*
   or *base*. It is only when particular relations are
   intended that suitable case-endings are applied
   to the stem. Thus, when we understand
   'Buddha' *doing something*, we use the nominative
   form *Buddho*; and, when we mean
   'Buddha' as the *object of an action*, we
   employ the accusative *Buddhaṁ* ; again, if we
   want to express something done by 'Buddha,'
   we make use of the instrumental *Buddhena*,
   In this way, all the case-forms can be used to
   convey different senses, as is shown below.

   **The Use of Cases**

   * *Paṭhamā*

     1. *Lingatthe*, — in the sense of the crude form (i.e.,
         stem or nominal base), e.g., *Buddho*, *puriso* (*vide*
         Kaccāyana, З, 1. 14).

     2. *Ālapane ca*, — in vocation too, e.g., *bho purisa*,
       *bhavanto  purisā* ; *bho rāja*, *bhavanto rājāno* ;
       *he sakha*, *he sakhino* (*vide* Kaccāyana, 3. 1. 15).

     3. To denote the *kattā* or subject, e.g., *so* karoti ;
       *Satthā* aṁtaṁ āhari.

   * *Dutiyā*

     1. *Kammatthe*, — to denote an object, e.g., *rathaṁ*
       karoti ; *dhammaṁ* suṇāti ; *vācaṁ* bhāsati ; *gavaṁ*

   * *Tatiyā*

     1. *Kattari ca*, — to denote the agent too (beside the
       Paṭhamā), e.g., *raññā* hato poso; *Yakkhena*
       dinno varo ; *ahinā* daṭṭho naro (*vide* Kaccāyana,
       3.1.18).

     2. *Karane*, — to denote instrumentality, e.g., agginā kuṭiṁ
       jhāpeti ; manasā ce padutthena ; *kāyena* kammaṁ
       karoti (*vide* Kaccāyana, 3.1.16).

   * *Catutthī*

     1. *Sampadāne*, — to denote the recipient, e.g., *Buddhassa*
       vā *Dhammassa* vā *Saṅghassa* và dāпаṁ deti (*vide*
       Кассāуапа, 3.1.23).

        * [One to whom something is desired to be
          given, or one who entertains a liking for
          something, or one from whom something
          is taken as debt, is put in the Dative
          case — *Yassa dātukāmo rocate vā dhārayate vā taṁ Sampadānaṁ*
          (vide Kaccāyana, 3.1.6), e.g., *samaṇassa* cīvaraṁ
          dadāti;  *samaṇassa* rocate вассаṁ ;
          suvaṇṇaṁ *me* dhārayate.]

   * *Раñсаmī*

     1. *Apādāne*, — to denote the Ablative, e.g., *pāpā* cittaṁ
        nivaraye ; *abbhā* mutto vā candimā;  *bhayā*
        muccati so naro (*vide* Kaccayana, 3.1.25).

        * [The Ablative case signifies that from which
          some person or thing goes off or fear
          arises or something is received -
          *Yasmādapeti bhayaṁ adatte vā tad Apādānaṁ*
          (*vide* Kaccāyana 3. 1. 1), e.g., gāmā
          apenti munayo ; *паgarā* niggato rājā;
          corā bhayaṁ jayāte ; ācariy’upajjhāyehi
          sikkhaṁ gaṇhāti sisso.]

   * *Chaṭṭhī*

     1. *Sāmismiṁ*, — to denote ownership, e.g., *tassa bhikkhuno*
        paṭivisaṁ ; *tassa  bhikkhuno* pattaṁ;
        *tassa bhikkhuno* civaraṁ ; *attano* mukhaṁ (*vide*
        Kaccāyana, 3.1.31).

   * *Sattamī*

     1. *Okāse*, — to denote location, e.g., *gambhīre odak'aṇṇave*;
        *pāpasmiṁ* ramati mano; *Bhagavati*
        brahmacariyaṁ vasati kulaputto (*vide* Kaccāyana,
        3.1.32).

        * [The site of an action is called *Okāsa* (location),
          and the Locative case signifies 'site' —
          *Yo'dhāro taṁ okāsaṁ* (*vide* Kaccāyana, 9.1.8).
          *Site* is of four kinds :—

          1. *Vyāpiko* ог co-extensive, — e.g., *jalesu
             khīraṁ* ; *tilesu* telaṁ ; *ucchūsu* raso.

          2. *Opasilesiko* or contiguous, — e.g., *pariyaṅke*
             rājā seti ; *āsane* upaviṭṭho Saṅgho.

          3. *Vesayiko* or objective, i.e., relating to
             place or quarter, — e.g., *bhūmisu* manussā ;
             *antarikkhe* vāyu ; *ākāsе* sakunā.

          4. *Sāmīpiko* or proximate, adjacent, e.g.,
             *vane* hatthino ; *Gaṅgāyaṁ* ghoso ; *vaje*
             gāviṁ duhanti ; *Sāvatthiyaṁ* viharati
             *Jetavane*.]

8. Nouns are divided into four classes, according
   4 as they have (1) one gender, (2) two genders,
   (3) three genders, and (4) no gender.

   1. **Declension of Nouns having one Gender** —
   masculine, feminine or neuter.

         pañcadasa, paṇṇarasa, solasa, sorasa, sattadasa, sattarasa,
         aṭṭhadasa and aṭṭhārasa are declined like *Раñса* and
         are the same in all genders.

         Vīsati, tiṁsati, saṭṭhi, sattati, asīti, navuti, koṭi are,
         when used alone, feminine stems in the singular number,
         and they are declined like *Ratti*. All the case-endings used
         after the stems cattāḷīsa and paññāsa are elided. The
         stems sata, sahassa efc. are neuter and singular, when
         used alone.

         The stem vīsati can be used in the plural number in
         all instances, when they are differentiated by some other
         number, e.g.—

         * Dve *vīsatiyo* Buddhadantā, 'twice twenty (i.e., 40)
           teeth of Buddha.’
         * Tisso *vīsatiyo* dinaghaṭikā, ‘thrice twenty (i.e., 60)
           hours of a day.'

         Such is also the case with the numerals tiṁsati, saṭṭhi,
         sattati etc., and sata, sahassa etc.]

   4. Nouns having no Gender (Ālinga).

      1. *Some 'suffix-formed' words.* — There are some
         suffixes which can be used in place of certain case-endings,
         e.g., -to; -tra, -tha; -va; -hiṁ, -haṁ, -hiñcanaṁ;
         -ha, -dha; -dhi; -dā, -dācanaṁ; -dāni, -dā; -jja, -jju;
         -rahi, -dhunā, -dāni. Stems, masculine, feminine ог
         neuter, when these suffixes are joined, become *words*
         (noun or pronoun), because the suffixes themselves are
         regarded as case-endings. Hence, no more case-endings
         are required. The words thus formed have no
         Gender of their own, nor do they admit of declension :—

      2. *The Prefixes or Prepositions (Upasaggas)* — They
         are so called because they are pre-fixed to words, e.g.,
         pa-haro, pa-harati. They cannot be declined, as all case-
         endings are elided after them, and they have no Gender
         or Number. The Prefixes or Upasaggas are twenty:
         pa, parā, ni, nī, u, du, saṁ, vi, ava, anu, pari, adhi, abhi,
         pati, su, ā, ati, api, apa, uра.

      3. *The Indeclinables (Nipatas)*. — These are particles
         and words which do not admit of declension, as all
         case-endings are dropped after them, and they, too,
         have no Gender or Number. The Indeclinables or
         Nipatas are: ca, na, va, vā, mā, hi, dhi, ci, ku, tu, nu,
         ce, re, he, sve, ve, vo, kho, no, to, yaṁ, naṁ, taṁ, kiṁ;

         Handa, kira, eva, kıva, yāva, tāva, vata, vatha, atha,
         аṅgа, iṅgha, taggha, āma, nāma, nūna, puna, pana, āһа,
         saha, musā, sakkā, labbhā, heṭṭhā, ārā, dūra, divā, navā,
         vinā, nānā, addhā, muddhā, micchā, paccha, āvi, sakkhi,
         sacci, sacchi, bahi, yadi, iti, kinti, atthi, sotthi, khalu,
         nanu, kimu, assu, yagghe, sace, have, suve, suvo, are, pure,
         namo, tiro, adho, atho, aho, raho, hiyyo, bhiyyo, anto,
         pāto, sudaṁ, kallaṁ, evaṁ, dhuvaṁ, alaṁ, halaṁ,
         sayaṁ, sāyaṁ, samaṁ, sāṁam, kāmaṁ, paraṁ, oraṁ,
         ciraṁ, huraṁ, аһаṁ, sahaṁ,  uccaṁ, nīcaṁ,  sakiṁ,
         saddhiṁ ;

         Athavā, antarā, ārakā, bāhirā, bahiddhā, yāvatā,
         tāvatā, samantā, sāmantā, āmantā, sammukhā, carahi,
         tarahi, sampati, āyati, upari, yāvade, tāvade, tiriyaṁ,
         sanikaṁ, sasakkaṁ;

         Etarahi, ettāvatā, parammukhā, kittāvatā, aññadatthu,
         seyyathīdaṁ, appevanūma, bhiyyosomattāya.

         [N.B. — All case-endings are elided also after the word
         'āvuso’, e.g., tvaṁ āvuso, tumhe āvuso.]

         The Indeclinables (Nipātas) have been defined by
         Grammarians as follows :—

         > Sadisā ye ti-liṅgesu sabbāsu ca vibhattisu \
         > vacanesu ca sabbesu te Nipātā ti kittitā.

         \- i.e., "those which are the same in the three genders, in all the case-endings and all the numbers, are  called Nipātas (Indeclinables)."

         Thus, the nipāta uccaṁ, for instance, remains unchanged in respect of Gender, whatever the Gender of the noun  with which it is used: - *uccaṁ* rukkho (m.) ; *uccaṁ* latā (f.) ; *uccaṁ* gharāni (n.). So also in respect of  Case-endings: - *uccaṁ* rukkho (nom.); *uccaṁ* rukkhaṁ (acc.); *uccaṁ* rukkhena (instr.), and so on. And so,  too, in respect of Number: -*uccaṁ* rukkho (sing.); *uccaṁ* rukkhā (pl.).

         Prefixes and Indeclinables, such as express 'self,' 'action,' 'place,' 'time,' 'direction,' 'qualities,'
         etc., can be reckoned in the sense of the corresponding case-endings. Thus -

         * *Adhi* may be used in the sense of the 7th case, e.g., *adhitthi*, which expresses the sense of the Locative *itthiyaṁ*.

         * *Anto* can express the sense of the 7th case, e.g., *antonagaraṁ* for *nagare* (Locative).

         * *Sayaṁ* may be interpreted in the sense of the 3rd and of the 0th case, r.g., *sayaṁkataṁ* for *attanā* (3rd) *kataṁ*; *sayaṁpabhā* for *attano* (0th) *pabhā*; sometimes, in the sense of the 1st case, e.g., *sayaṁbhū* for *sayaṁ* (1st) *bhavati*.

         * *Namo* may be regarded in the sense of the 1st and of the 2nd case, c.g., *Namo tyathu*, where *namo* is in the Nominative ; *namo karohi*, where *namo* is in the Accusative.

         * *Divā* can fit itself to the sense of the 1st or the 2nd or the 7th case, e.g., *divā hoti*, where *divā* is in the Nominative ; *divākaro*, where *divā* expresses the sense of the Accusative; *divā tapati ādicco*, where *divā* conveys the sense of the Locative.

         * *Heṭṭhā* can convey the sense of the Locative and can, therefore, be said to answer to the 7th case, e.g., *heṭṭhā gopphakapariyantaṁ*, where *heṭṭhā* means 'downwards' and thus points to *direction*, which must be expressed by the 7th case-ending.

         * *Uccaṁ* is good for all the cases. See above (p. 64).

         * *He*, in the sense of the Vocative, relates to the first case.

         The remaining Prefixes (*pa*-saddas) and Indeclinables (*ca*-saddas) are to be reckoned in the sense of the 1st case-ending.

         Prefixes are always attached to other words, but some of the Indeclinables are used separately. e.g., -

         * Prefix: *pa*hāro, *pa*harati;
         * Indeclinables: so *ca*; sā *ca*; bhāsati *vā* karoti *vā*.

## VII. SAMASA (Compounds)

### 1. Nāmānam Samāso yutt'athho.

**Samāsa** (Compound) is the aggregation of the meanings of words used to denote names:

* Rañño putto = Rāja-putto.
* Āgantukassa bhattaṁ = Āgantuka-bhattam.
* Samaṇo ca brāhmaṇo ca = Samaṇa-brāhmaṇā.

### 2. Tesaṁ vibhattiyo lopā ca — Pakati c'assa sar'antassa.

And the case-endings of those words which are united in a compound are (generally) elided.

And the case-endings having elided, the words ending in vowels assume their basic forms (and then the compound assumes gender, number and case):

* Cakkhuṁ ca sotaṁ ca = Cakkhu-sotaṁ.
* Cakkhuna ca sotena ca = Cakkhu-sotena.
* Cakkhūhi ca sotehi ca = Cakkhu-sotehi.
* Rañño putto = Rāja-putto.
* Rañño puriso = Rāja-puriso.

But, the case-ending is retained in such instances as Pabhaṃ karoti = Pabhaṃ-karo.

### 3. Dvipade tulyādhikaraṇe Kammadhārayo.

When two words (an adjective and a noun) possessing similar case-endings are combined, the combination is called **Kammadhāraya** or *Descriptive* Compound:

* Mahanto oa so vīro cā ti = Mahāvīro.
* Khattiyā ca sā kaññā cā ti=Khattiya-kaññā.

[In a Kammadhāraya compound, *mahanta* is generally changed to mahā and *ku* occasionally to *kā* or *kad* (according to Kaccāyana, 2. 7. 15); e.g., *mahā-vīro*, *kā-puriso*, *kadanno*; but, *ku-dārā*, *ku-puttā*, *ku-gohā*, *ku-dāsā*, *kuvatthā*. If both the words are feminine, the first member of the compound assumes the masculine form (according to Kaccāyana, 2. 7. 17); e. g., *khattiya*-kaññā, *mahā*-saddhā. Otherwise, there is no change ; as, *kumārī-ratanaṁ* (where *ratanaṁ* being neuter, the first member *kumārī*, which is used as an adjective, retains its feminine form).]

### 4. Saṅkhyāpubbo Digu—Diguss'ekattaṁ.

If the first member of a Descriptive Compound is a numeral, the combination is called **Digu** or *Numeral* Compound, which becomes singular and neuter :

* Tayo lokā samāhaṭā = Tilokaṁ. So also, Catuddisaṁ, Pañcindriyaṁ.

### 5. U'bhe Tappurisā-Amādayo parapadehiAttam Nassa Tappurise—Sare An.

Numeral Compounds (Digu) and Descriptive Compounds (Kammadhāraya) are both called **Tappurisa** or *Determinative* Compounds.

When the first member possesses one or other of the case-endings aṁ, nā, etc. (i.e., the second, the third and so on), excepting the nominative and the vocative, and determines the meaning of the second member, their combination is called **Tappurisa** or *Determinative*.

In combination the case-ending of the first member is generally dropped. There are six kinds of Tappurisa Compound:

1. Bhūmiṁ gato = Bhūmi-gato (2nd Tappurisa). \
   Sabbarattiṁ sobhano = Sabbaratti-sobhano (Do.).
2. Issarena kataṁ = Issara-kataṁ (3rd Tappurisa). \
   Sallena viddhaṁ = Salla-viddhaṁ (Do.).
3. Kaṭhinassa dussaṁ = Kaṭhina-dussaṁ (4th Tappurisa). \
   Āgantukassa bhattaṁ = Āgantuka-bhattaṁ (4th Tappurisa).
4. Methunasmā apeto = Methunāpeto (5th Tappurisa). \
   Rājato bhayaṁ = Rāja-bhayaṁ (6th Tappurisa). \
   Corā bhayaṁ = Cora-bhayaṁ (Do.).
5. Rañño putto = Rāja-putto (6th Tappurisa). \
   Dhaññanaṃ rāsi = Dhañña-rāsi (Do.).
6. Rūpe saññā = Rūpa-saññā (7th Tappurisa). \
   Saṁsāre dukkhaṁ = Saṁsāra-dukkhaṁ (Do.).

If "na" is the first member in a Determinative Compound, it is changed into "a":

Na euro $=$ a-suro; na Brāhmaṇo $=$ aBrāhmaṇo; na vasalī=a-vasalī; na bhikkhu = abhikkhu; na pañca-vasso=a-pañcavasso; na punageyyā=a-punageyyā. [A Kammadhāraya combination, having a nipāta as its first member, is called "Nañ Tatpuruṣa" in Sanskrit Grammar.]
But, if a vowel follows, the "na" becomes "an":

Na asso=an-asso.

### 6. Aññapad' atthesu Bahubbthi.

Attributive Compounds are of two kinds:

1. Tulyādhikaraña.-When the words which are combined together are of the same gender, number and case, the samāsa is called Tulyādhikaraṇa Bahubbīhi:

Agatā samanā yam sānghārāman̉ so-Āgatasamano sānghārāmo (where āgatā and saman $\bar{a}$ are both masculine, plural and nominative).
2. Bhinnādhikaraña-When the words which are combined together are different in gender, number and case, the samāsa is called Bhinnādhikaraṇa Bahubbīhi:

Pupphehi bhavo yassa so-Puppha-bhavo (where pupphehi is neuter, plural and ablative, while bhavo is masculine, singular and nominative).

### 7. Nāmānan samuccayo Dvando.

When several words (denoting names) in the same case are joined together, the Compound is called Dyanda or Aggregative :

Candimã ca suriyo ca-Candima-suriyã.
$\left.\begin{array}{l}\text { Narã ca nãriyo ca } \\ \text { Naro ca nãrĩ ca }\end{array}\right\}$ -Nara-nãriyo.
Akkharam் ca padam் ca Akkharãni ca padãni ca $\}$ —Akkhara-padãni.
Similarly, Samana-brãhmaṇã, Sãriputta-Moggallãnã, Brãhmaṇa-gahapatikã, Yama-Varuṇã, Kuvera-Vãsavã and so on.

### 8. Tathã Dvande pãni-turiya-yogga-senangakhuddajantuka-vividha-viruddha-visabhãg'at-thãdĩnam ca.

Similarly, Sila-paūñari, Samatha-vipassanari, Vijjā-caranam.

### 9. Vibhāsā rukkha-tina-pasu-dhana-dhañ̄najanapadādīnam ca.

A Dvanda compound, consisting of words of the following among other descriptions, is also put in the singular number and neuter gender, optionally :-

1. denoting trees: Dhava-khādirarh, Dhavakhādirā ; Assattha-kapittharh, Assatthakapitthā ;

### 10. Upasagga-Nipāta-pubbako Abyayībhāvo.

The combination of words with upasagga or nipāta in the following among other senses is called Abyayībhāya or Indeclinable
Compound. The compound is put in the neuter gender [vide Kaccāyana, 2.7.5] and the final vowel is made short [vide Kaccāyana, 2.7.27]:

Cittam adhikicca $=$ Adhicittañ.

## VIIIA KĀRAKA (Complementives[^20])

### 1. Karoti kiriyam nipphādetīti Kārakam.

Kāraka or the Complementive[^20] is so called because it completes an action (see p. 33).

There are six Kārakas: Kamma, Kattu, Karana, Sampadāna, Apādāna, and Okāsa or Adhikarana. Sāmī or the Genitive and Alapana or the Vocative are not regarded as Kāraka, because neither of them satisfies the required condition.

[^20]: The term has been coined by me. - S. M.

### 2. Yami karoti tam Kammam.

That which one does (sees or hears), is called the Object :
o. g., Ratham karoti, [See examples under Dutiyā, p. 34.]

### 3. Yo karoti sa Kattā.

One who does an action is called the Agent :
o. g., Ahina daṭtho naro, Garuḷna hato nāgo, Buddheena jito Mâro; Upaguttena bandho Mâro; where the italicized words are the Agents, because each of them performs an action. [See example iii, under Pathamā, p. 84.]

### 4. Yena va kayirate tam Karapam.

That by means of which an act of doing (seeing or hearing) is accomplished is called the Instrument :
c. g., Dattena vihin lunāti; vāsiyā rukkhanh tacchati; pharasunā rukkhan chindati; kuddālena rukkham khanati; hatthena kammam karoti; caklkhunā rūpam passati; sotena saddarh suṇāti. [See example ii, under Tatiyā, p. 84.]

### 5. Yassa dātukāmo rocate vā dhārayate vā tarh Sampadānam.

One to whom something is desired to be given, or one who entertains a liking for something,
or one from whom something is taken as a debt is called the Dative :
c. g., Samanassa cīvaram dadāti; samanassa rocate saccam; Devadattassa suvapnachattam dhārayate Yaññadatto; suvapnam me dhārayate. [See example $i$, under Catutthī, p. 84.]
[The Dative (Sampadāna) is also distinguished in the following ways :-
(i) in connection with the following roots the object assumes the sense of the Dative: (a) silāgha (to flatter or boast of), e.g., Buddhassa silāghate ; (b) hanu (to hide from), e.g., hanute mayham eva; (c) upa + th $\bar{a}$ (to worship or wait on), e.g., upatiṭtheyya Sakyaputtānam vaḍ̣haki ; (d) sapa (to blame or curse), e.g., mayham sapate; (e) dhāra (to owe to any person), e.g., suvapnam to dhārayate ; (f) piha (to long for), e.g., Buddhassa aññatitthiṣa pihayanti, samiddhānam pihayanti dalidda ; (g) kudha (to be angry with), e.g., kodhayati Devadattassa, tassa kujjha mahāvīa; (h) duha (to meditate mischief), e.g., duhayati disānam̉ megho ; (i) issa (to envy), e.g., titthiya samanānam issayanti; (j) usuyya (to grumble at), e.g., titthiyā samanānam usuyyanti, lābhagiddhena dujjanā guṇavantānam̉ usuyyanti ;
(ii) in connection with the roots rädha and $i k k h a$ when used in answer to a query, the object can be both Dative or Accusative, e.g., ārādho me rañño (also, räjānam) ; āyasmato Upālitherassa (also, āyasmantam Upālitheram) upasampadāpekkho Upatisso ;
(iii) in connection with the root suṇa (with the prefix pati or $\bar{a}$ ) and the root gina (with the prefix anu or pati), that which was previously in the Nominative becomes Dative, e.g., Bhagavā (Nominative) bhikkhū etad avoca, Bhagavato (Dative) paccassosum̉ te bhikkhū ; Bhikkhu (Nominative) janam dhamman̉ sāveti, tassa bhikkhuno (Dative) jano anugināti;
(iv) in connection with words signifying announcement ("Rocan'attha"), e.g., ārocayāmi vo bhikkhave, āmantayāmi vo bhikkhave ;
(v) in denoting aim or purpose "Tadattha" e.g., ūnassa paripuriyā, Buddhassa atthāya ;
(vi) in signifying the meaning of the infinitive suffix tum ("Tumattha"), e.g., lokānukampāya, phāsuvihārāya ;

(viii) if the object of the root mañña be an inanimate thing and if it denotes disrespect, it assumes the sense of the Dative ("Mañn'and $d a r^{\prime} a p p \bar{a} n i n i^{\prime "}$ ), e.g., katṭhassa tuvarn mañe, kalingarassa tuvarn mañe ; but, suvampan tam mañe, gadrabham tam mañe ;
(ix) the object of verbs denoting 'going' assumes the sense of the Dative ("Gatyatthakammani"), e.g., gāmassa pādena gato, appo saggāya gacchati, mūlāya paṭikasseyya Sangho ;
(x) in denoting good wish ("Āsims'attha"), e.g., bhaddarī bhavato hotu, kusalari bhavato hotu ;
(xi) in connection with the word sammuti, 'consent' ("Sammutippayoge"), e.g., sādhu sammuti $m e$ tassa Bhagavato dassanāya ;
(xii) in connection with the word bhiyya 'more', 'abundant' ("Bhiyyappayoge"), e.g., bhiyyosomattāya ;
(xiii) in the sense of the Seventh case ("Sattamyattha"), e.g., tuyham (=tava santike) āvikaromi, tassa me Sakko pāturahosi.

The Dative is used not merely in connection with a particular word of a particular signification, but in connection with all words of that signification, e.g., upamari te karissāmi, dhammanī vo bhikkhave desissāmi, desetu bhante Bhagavā dhamman̄ bhikkhūnan̉, tassa phāsu, tassa pahipeyya, amhākain man̉inā attho, kimattho me Buddhena, seyyo me attho, etc.

Sometimes, the endings of the Second, Third and Sixth cases are used.]

### 6. Yasmādapeti bhayamādatte vā tad Apādānan̉.

That from which a person or thing goes away or fear arises or something is received is called the Ablative :
e. g., Gāmā apenti munayo; nagarā niggato rājā; pāpā cittañ nivārayc; corā bhayañ jāyate; ācariy'upajjhāyehi sikkham் ganhāti sisso. [See example $i$ under Pañcamī, p. 85.]
[The Ablative (Apādāna) is also distinguished in the following ways:
(i) in connection with roots used with particular prefixes, e.g., $p a-n+\sqrt{ } j i$ (to subdue): Buddhasmā parājenti aññatitthiyā (where "Buddha," because he cannot be subdued, and not merely because he is the subduer, is put in the Ablative) ; $p a+\sqrt{ } b h \bar{u}$ (to spring, proceed, arise): Himavantā pabhavanti pañca mahānadiyo (here, "Himavanta," from which the five rivers proceed, is put in the Ablative) ;
(ii) in connection with particular nāma (noun or word), e.g., urasm $\bar{a}$ jāto putto, bhūmito niggato raso, ubhato sujāto putto, tato pabhuti, nàñ̃̃añ dukkhā, bhinno Devadattā ;

(iv) in connection with words denoting objects lying between two Kārakas, e.g., kosā vijjhati kunjaram (where the distance of a kosa lies between two kārakas, the agent and the
object, i.e., elephant) ; similarly, -māsasm $\bar{a}$ bhuñjati bhojanam, pakkhasmā vijjhati migam ;
(v) in connection with nipātas (indeclinables), when the endings of the Fifth case are used as well as those of the Second and Third cases, e.g., rahita ('bereft of,' 'without') mātujā (5th case), rahitā mātujam (2nd case), rahitā mātujena (3rd case) ; similarly,-rite ('without') saddhammā, saddhammam, saddhammena; so also with vinā ('without'), nānā ('various'), puthu ('separate,' 'different') ;
(vi) in connection with verbs denoting protection, where the object desired to be protected from any person or thing acquires the Ablative sense, e.g., uechuto sigāle rakkhati, yava patisedhenti gāvo; sometimes the endings of the Seventh case are used instead of those of the Fifth: kāke rakkhanti taṇ̣ulā;
(vii) in connection with that from which disappearance is desired, e.g., upajjhāya antaradhāyati sisso; mātarā ca pitarā ca (5th case) antaradhāyati putto; sometimes the endings of the Seventh case are used: Jetavane (7th case) antaradhāyati Bhagavā ;
(viii) in connection with words
(a) denoting distance (dūra), e.g., kivadūro ito Nalakāragāmo; sometimes the endings of the Second and Third cases are used: dūraio (also, dūram and dūrena) āgamma, ārakā te imasmā dhammavinayā (also, imam dhammavinayam, anena dhammavinayena) ;
(b) denoting vicinity (antika), e.g., antikam gāmā, āsannam gāmā, samīpam gāmā; the endings
of the Second and Third cases may also be used: antikam் gāmañ or gāmena, etc. ;
(c) denoting space or time (addha-käla), e.g., ito Mathurāya catūsu yojanesu Sañkassa-nagarari atthi (Space), ito ekanavuti-kappa-matthake (Time) ;
(d) left alone by the elision of verbal forms in -tvā (tvā-lopa), e.g., pāsăda sanikameyya (which originally stood as: pāsădam abhirūhitvā sañkameyya), āsanā vutṭhaheyya (which was: āsane nisīditvā vutṭhaheyya), pāsăda passati (which was: pāsădam abhirūhitvā passati); the Ablative here represents Accusative (Kamma) and Locative (Adhikarana) constructions;
(e) denoting direction (disā-yoga), e.g., Avicito upari ; puratthimato, dakkhipato, pacchimato, uttarato ; yato assosum Bhagavato kittisaddam ; uddham̉ pādatalā, adho kesamatthaka ;
(f) denoting comparison (vibhatta), e.g., yato panitataro, yato visitthataro; the endings of the Sixth case are sometimes used: channavutīnam pāsaṇ̣̄̄nam dhammanam pavarami idarī Sugatavinayan;

( $m$ ) used with pubba ('before') (pubba-yoga), e.g., pubb'eva me bhikkhave sambodhā ;
( $n$ ) denoting the act of binding or tying (bandhan' attha), e.g., satasmā bandho naro (also, sateña, with the ending of the Third case);
(o) denoting attribute or quality (guna-vacana), e.g., paññāya sugatirn yanti, issariyā (i.e., issariyaguṇa-hetuto) rājā janarh rakkhati ;
(p) left alone by the elision of verbal forms in -tvā, and in answer to a query (pañhe tvālope), e.g., Abhidhammā (originally, Abhidhammam் sutvā, or Abhidhamme thatvā) pucchanti; the Ablative here stands for the Accusative (Kamma) and Locative (Adhikaraṇa) constructions. Instead of the Fifth case-ending, those of the Second and the Third are also used: Abhidhammam, Abhidhammena pucchanti ; similarly, - Vinayā, Vinayari, Vinayena, etc. ;

### 7. Yo 'dhāro tam̉ Okāsam̉.

The place of an action is called the Okāsa or the Locative.
[See examples under under Sattamī, pp. 35-36.]

## VIIIB VIBHATTI-BHEDA (Cases and Case-endings)

[The Vibhatti or the Case must not be confused with the Kāraka. A Kāraka is one of the many causes that accounts for the use of a Vibhatti, and the latter can bring home to us the sense of the Kāraka that may have caused it. For instance, the Paṭhamā-vibhatti (see p. 34) can be accounted for not only by means of the Kattu-kāraka but also by Lingattha and Alapana (see Kaccāyana) and it can help us to determine the sense of the Kattu-kāraka. A loose enumeration of the Vibhattis are given at p. 31, sec. 5, where they appear as eight; but strictly speaking, they are seven in number, excluding
the Alapana, which in English grammar is distinguished as the Case of Address. Only a rough idea of the use of the seven Vibhattis is given at pages 34-36; a detailed treatment of them will be found below.]

### Paṭhamā (The First Case) 

#### 1. Ling'atthe Paṭhamā.

The endings of the First Case are used, when only the sense of the crude form (i.e., stem or nominal base) is spoken of :

Puriso, purisā ; eko, dve ; aham, etc.
The agent when in the Active Voice (Kartrvācya) and the object when in the Passive (Karmavācya) require the ending of the First Case, which is also used if a word is governed by some Indeclinables, e.g.,-

Sudo odanam pacati (Active), Sūdena odano paccate (Passive) ; similarly, -Buddho dhammam desesi, Buddhena dhammo desito.

Nāgaseno nāma thero, Sīhaseno nāma putto (where "nāma," an Indeclinable, governs the Proper names).

#### 2. Ālapane ca.

The endings of the First Case are also used to express the sense of addressing, coupled with the sense of the crude form:
Bho purisa, bhavanto purisā ; bho rāja, bhavanto rājāno; he sakhha, he sakhino. [In the Bālāvatāra these formations are allowed by the Sūtra "Liṅgatthe Paṭhamā," but Rule 2 occurs separately in Kaccāyana.

### Dutiyā (the Second Case)

#### 1. Kammatthe Dutiyā.

The endings of the Second Case are used in denoting the object (in the Karty-vācya), i.e., the Accusative :

Buddham vande, unapattam bhunjati, kanṭakam maddati, visam gilati, ratham karoti, dhammam supāti, vācam bhāsati, tanḍulam pacati, coram ghāteṭi, gavami hanati.

#### 2. Kāladdhānamaccantasam̃yoge.

The endings of the Second Case are added to words denoting time or space, which have immediate proximity (to any object, attribute or action):

Māsam manisodano (where māsa denotes time and manisodano object-i.e., a 'manisodano' which can be eaten for a whole month. Here we have proximity of time with an object).

Saradam் ramanīyā nadī (where 'ramanīyatā' is an attribute of 'nadi,' which lasts throughout the season 'Sarada.' Here we have proximity of time with an attribute).

Māsam sajjhāyati (where the action of 'sajjhāyana' continues throughout a 'māsa.' Here we have proximity of time with an action).
Yojanami vanarāji (proximity of space, yojana, with an object, vanarāji).
Yojanam̉ dīgho pabbato (proximity of space with an attribute, dīgha).
Kosam sajjhāyati (proximity of space with an action, sajjhāynti).

#### 3. Kammappavacanīya-yutte.

The endings of the Second Case are added to words used in connection with terms (certain prepositions, particles or adverbs) employed to define an action (Kammappavacanīya).

Such terms are: anu, pati, pari and abhi.
Anu expresses the senses of (i) aiming at, (ii) pervasion, (iii) exception, (iv) portion, (v) homogeneity, and (vi) inferiority: e.g.,
(i) Rukkham் anu vijjotate cando (where the idea is that the moon is shining with the tree as its aim ; the act of 'aiming at' is expressed by the Kammappavacanīya 'anu' ; hence, rukkham, which it governs, takes the ending of the Second Case).
(ii) Bukkhami rukkhami anu vijjotate cando (where 'anu' expresses 'pervasion'; hence the repetition rukkhami rukkhami and the ending of the Second Case).
(iii) Sädhu Devadatto mätarami anu (where the meaning is that Devadatta is not by nature good, but he is good towards his mother; hence, the Second Case-ending in mätarain, which is governed by 'anu,' denoting 'exception').
(iv) Yad ettha mam anu siyā tan diyatu (which means: Give me that which is my portion; thus 'anu' has the force of 'share or portion,' and accordingly mam has the Second Case-ending).
(v) Nadim anvavasitā Bārānasī (where 'Bārānasī' together with 'nadi' makes one complete whole; therefore, 'anu' in anvavasita (anu + ava + sitā, Sk. sritā) denoting 'homogeneity,' nadim has the Second Case-ending).
(vi) Anu Sāriputtam paññavā bhikkhu (which means that the bhikkhu is wise, but that he is inferior to Sāriputta in wisdom; hence, 'anu' having the force of 'inferiority,' Sāriputtam has the Second Case-ending).
