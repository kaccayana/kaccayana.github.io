This is a rough and quick translation of Bālāvatāra into English. If you spot any errors, let me know.

Bālāvatāra is an introductory Pāli grammar for beginners, by Dhammakitti, written in the fourteenth century. It is based on Kaccāyana (it references Kaccāyana rules) and gives the basics of Pāli grammar suitable for beginners in the language. The text is written in a simple and straightforward style, making it easy to understand for beginners. Dhammakitti was a renowned scholar and author of several important works on Pāli grammar and Buddhist philosophy, including Saddhammalahkara, Jinabodhavali, Samkhepa, Nikaya-sangraha, and Bālāvatāra.

He succeeded his master in the office of Sangharaja. He was also called Devarakkhita or Jayabahu Maha-thera, and lived in the reigns of Bhuvaneka-bahu V and Vira-bahu III (1372-1410).[^1]
