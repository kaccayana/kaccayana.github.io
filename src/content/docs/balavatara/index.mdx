This is a rough and quick translation of Bālāvatāra into English. If you spot any errors, let me know.

The text for Bālāvatāra is sourced from [Pāḷi Tipiṭaka](https://tipitaka.org) which is a digital reproduction of the authenticated Tipitaka texts from the [Chaṭṭha Saṅgāyana](https://www.tipitaka.org/chattha.html) CD published by the [Vipassana Research Institute](http://www.vridhamma.org/Home.aspx).
